Circular No.: AL/MQS-02/2021 1% January, 2021

TO ALL REGISTERED TEA MANUFACTURERS, TEA EXPORTERS AND
IMPORTERS OF TEA FOR VALUE ADDITION AND RE-EXPORT OF THE SAME

Dear Sirs,

Sri Lanka Tea Board Standards/ Directives for Tea
Issued under the Sri Lanka Tea Board Law No. 14 of 1975, Tea Control Act No 51 of 1957,
Tea (Tax & Control of Export) Act No 16 of 1959 and Sri Lanka (Import & Export)
Regulations 1981 - Scheme for import of tea for blending and export thereafter
(This Circular Supersedes Tea Board Circular No.: AL/MQS-Rev/2010, issued on 26"" April 2010)

Sri Lanka Tea Board as the monitoring authority of quality standard of teas
exported is mandated to protect the image of ‘Ceylon tea’ established globally. As you are
aware, Tea Board has introduced a set of standards/ guidelines in the year 2008, and then
revised in 2010 under the power vested by its Act. As a protective measure of teas
produced from Sri Lanka, Tea Board has introduced and implements Standards and
Directives for “Sri Lankan Origin Teas” and “Other Origin Teas” which are imported for
re-export purposes. The Minimum Quality Standard (MQS) will cover both ISO 3720 for
Black Tea and ISO 11287 for Green Tea.

02. The directives pertaining to the limits indicated in this circular (Annexure - A
other than the established ISO standards, i.e. Extraneous matters, Detectable Metals,
Microbial Contaminants and Maximum Residue Limits of Pesticides etc.,) are required to be
complied by all registered manufacturers and exporters of Sri Lankan Origin Tea.

03. ‘The limits indicated in the Annexure - B are considered as standards and should be
strictly applicable for all other origin teas at the point of importation and exportation of
the same after value addition. Hence non conformity of such standards in any other origin
teas will be treated as grounds for rejection of import / re-export.

04. The above Directives and Standards are implemented with effect from 1°' January,
2021.

ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.DM Ei

 

Issued in: February 2024 Serial No. 04/24

PROTECTION OF TEA FROM BLISTER BLIGHT

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular DM 1, Serial No. 1/02 issued in October 2002 and
related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 2)

1. Introduction

Blister blight disease of tea is caused by a fungus (Exobasidium vexans Massee.) and is spread
by wind- borne spores. A high relative humidity (85%) is required for spore production and their
release. Most importantly high moisture on the leaf surface favors germination of spores and
infection. Therefore, conditions of persistent mist and dew are particularly conducive to high levels
of infection. The spores are killed when they are exposed to either direct sunlight or desiccation.
The disease is of great economic importance during the rainy seasons at mid and high elevations
(>600 m).

Blister blight fungus can infect only young succulent leaves and tender stems. As the leaves and
stems mature, they become immune to infection.

2. Disease Management

Integrated disease management inclusive of plant resistance, cultural practices and chemical
spraying is emphasized.

2.1 Resistant Cultivars

No cultivars have so far been found to be totally resistant to this disease. Only gradations of
susceptibility have been found in the various cultivars of tea. Growing resistant cultivars is the best
option. The amount of money spent on chemical control can be proportionately reduced with the
increase in resistance of a selected cultivars. To select blister blight resistant cultivar/s for planting,
please refer Advisory Circular PN 1.

2.2 Cultural Methods

Cultural practices are the measures undertaken to prevent and control the disease by
manipulating plants and the environment. These practices include the following:

1. Shade management: Thinning and removal of excess shade to provide adequate sun light
and ventilation.

2. Plucking manipulation: Shorter plucking rounds and hard plucking to remove infected leaves
and reduce the amount of inoculum and the rate of spread.

3. Good Agricultural Practices: Timely and balanced fertilization avoiding unnecessary
succulence of the foliage, and timely weed management in the pruned fields up to tipping to
avoid stem blisters.

2.3 Chemical Methods

The following categories of fungicides, which have protective and curative mode of action, can be
used to control the Blister Blight Disease in tea.

1. Protective - Copper Fungicides

2. Curative - Systemic Fungicides
2.3.1 Copper Fungicides

Copper fungicides, which are protective in their action, have been found to give adequate
protection against blister blight in tea. When sprayed, copper deposited on the leaf surface
prevents the germination of spores, thereby preventing infection. However, copper will have no
effect if applied after the fungus has penetrated the leaf surface.

The main ingredient of these fungicides is metallic copper (Cu) and can be available in the forms
of oxides, oxychlorides, hydroxides or sulphates. Their formulations could be either wettable
powders (WP), dry-flowable powders (DF), wettable granules (WG) and suspension concentrate
(SC). All recommendations are based on copper formulations having 50% copper (w/w) or lower.
Different dosages are recommended for different formulations due to the differences in fineness of
the commercial preparations and their resultant spreadability/miscibility in water.

Based on their solubility they have been categorized into two major groups. They are;
Group (a) - Copper oxides (insoluble in water)
Group (b) - Copper hydroxides, Tribasic copper sulphate (slightly soluble in water)

2.3.2 Systemic Fungicides

Systemic fungicides have both protective and curative properties. Unlike the protectant fungicides,
they can cure an established infection at early stages.

The disadvantages of the fungicides are the high costs, potential residues in made tea and the
likelihood of the fungus developing resistance to the fungicide and retain residues in made tea.

It is recommended to adopt the following strategies to overcome the disadvantages:

iF Use the lowest possible concentration of fungicide as recommended by the TRI based on
the disease severity.

ii. Alternate use of systemic fungicides that belong to different groups, possessing different
modes of action with protectant copper fungicides (except for plucking fields).

iii. Limit the total number of applications per season to a minimum possible, following
sunshine hours (cumulative total of 20 hours sunshine over the previous five days is
sufficient to prevent disease reaching an economic damage level).

iv. Avoid a fungicidal spray when there are a minimum of 4 hours of sunshine at a stretch for
5 consecutive days and during heavy rains.

2.4 Management of Blister Blight in Nurseries

Succulent stems and leaves of the nursery plants are attacked by blister blight, affecting the
overall growth of the plants.

Select cultivars resistant to blister blight for establishing a nursery (please refer Advisory Circular
PN1).

Avoid dense shade in nurseries during monsoonal weather.

Spray fungicides as recommended in Advisory Circular PU2. Apply copper fungicides and systemic
fungicides, either individually or as alternative sprays using a knapsack sprayer.

2.5 Management of Blister Blight in Young Tea

Tender young plants are also prone to heavy attacks of blister blight. Repeated heavy infections
could seriously damage newly establishing plants. Therefore, it is essential to pay more attention
for the control of blister blight at this stage of growth.
Closer spraying rounds are recommended using a knapsack sprayer in order to wet all the young
foliage and tender stems for maximum protection.

Use of both copper fungicides and systemic fungicides, either individually or as alternative spraying
are recommended for controlling Blister Blight in young tea fields.

Please refer Advisory Circular PU2, for the details of the products, dosages and the methods of
application.

2.6 Management of Blister Blight in Tea Recovering from Pruning

On account of blister blight, the most critical time for a tea bush is during the period it is recovering
after pruning. During this time all its leaves and shoots are young and tender. The loss of newly
emerging stems and leaves at this stage will cause a serious setback to growth. The regeneration
growth to replace dead shoots is possible only at further expense of food reserves. Therefore, if
the pruned bushes are not adequately protected, incidence of blister blight could cause very poor
recovery, which may even lead to their death.

Schedule lopping of shade trees at the onset of the monsoon and weeding in post-pruned fields.

Blister blight disease could be effectively controlled in pruned fields by strictly following the
fungicide spray schedules as recommended in Advisory Circular PU2. Both copper fungicides and
systemic fungicides can be applied in tea fields recovering from pruning.

Application of fungicides should commence with the bud break (approximately three weeks from
pruning) and be continued up to the time of tipping (approximately three months). For maximum
protection, it is preferable to use knapsack sprayers in order to wet all the young foliage and tender
stems. The last two applications prior to tipping should be carried out carefully, by making every
effort to get the lance into the bush. This would ensure that the tender parts, that would be
exposed, following tipping are also protected by the fungicides. The application of systemic
fungicides should be terminated 2-3 weeks before tipping in order avoid fungicide residues in the
final product.

2.7 Management of Blister Blight in Tea in Harvesting
2.7.1 Cultural Method
Reduce natural shade by lopping shade trees at the beginning of the monsoons;
i.e. April/May, in the Western sector
September/October, in the Eastern sector.

This allows maximum available sunshine falling on the plucking table, which in itself has fungicidal
properties.

Shorter plucking rounds (5-7 days) and hard plucking (up to fish leaf) reduce subsequent blister
blight infections. In order to improve the bush health, the fields may be rested or lightly plucked
intermittently for a period of 6-8 weeks following these practices.

2.7.2 Chemical Method

Only copper fungicides, using knapsack sprayers or mist-blowers, are recommended for controlling
Blister Blight in tea in harvesting. Spraying should be done on the day following harvesting or
immediately thereafter. In the event of harvesting rounds being delayed or extended, the spraying
rounds must be made sufficiently flexible, enabling a pre- harvest interval of 7 days with copper
fungicides, prior to harvesting.

 
Both, High Volume Sprays (hand-operated knapsack sprayers) or Low Volume Sprays (mist-
blowers) could be used to spray copper fungicides in tea fields in harvesting.

The following points are important for effective control of the disease:

vi.

Good protection depends on good supervision of spraying operation.

It is important that the recommended amount of fungicides be sprayed on to the stipulated
area for effective control.

Spraying during continuous heavy rain is not warranted for two reasons. First, there is less
likelihood of infection as the spores too could get washed off. Second, any fungicide applied
during this time could also get washed off. Cool humid weather with overcast skies is very
conducive for infection and spraying is best carried out during such periods. During light
drizzles spraying could be undertaken when they are not likely to wash off the fungicides from
leaves.

Spray equipment should be periodically checked and maintained in good condition.

Wettable powders should be first made into a paste with a little water and then diluted to the
required volume.

Personnel safety should be ensured by wearing personal protective equipment coverall,
gloves, mask, and shoes.

ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.DM EE

 

Issued in: February 2024 Serial No. 05/24

PROTECTION OF TEA FROM ROOT DISEASES

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular DM 2 Serial No 2/02 issued in October 2002 and related
previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 2)

1. Introduction

Tea bushes are infected by different types of pathogens resulting in root diseases. Red root disease,
Black root disease, Brown root disease, Charcoal rood disease, White root disease and Violet root
disease are the common root diseases damaging tea plants.

2. Symptoms and Diagnosis

The above ground symptoms of root diseases are alike. They are always symptoms of water shortage,
but they occur at times when the soil is not deficient of water. Their identification therefore depends
largely upon recognition of the fungi associated with the plants and their invaded roots.

2.1 Red Root Disease

Red root disease, commonly known as 'Poria root disease’ of tea, is caused by a fungus (Poria
hypolateritia Berk). This occurs most frequently in tea growing areas over 600 m (2000 ft) in elevation.
The disease can appear on solitary bushes or in patches. It usually spreads by means of mycelial
strands (fungal threads), which is able to grow through the soil. Therefore, root contact is not essential
for the spread of infection.

Proper diagnosis of the disease in the field is of fundamental importance in its control. The first
symptoms are yellowing of the foliage, followed by wilting and the sudden death of a part or the entire
bush with the withered leaves remaining attached for several days.

The affected bush must be uprooted with the roots. If the infection is fresh and active the fungal
mycelium could be seen as whitish specs on a reddish background, particularly towards the base of
the bush. If the infection has been there for some time, these symptoms can be seen only after
scraping the root-surface-soil-layers with a knife. The mycelium is initially white, soft and fluffy but turn
into smooth, thin, flat, dark red cords or sheets, with age. These dark cords are normally
inconspicuous. However, when such roots with old infections are soaked in water, the red cords of the
mycelium can be recognized. When the disease is at an advanced stage the roots become soft and
pulpy, making it difficult to extract from the soil.

2.2 Black Root Disease

The disease is caused by Rosellinia arcuata and R. bunoides. Rosellinia arcuata fungus forms
irregular, black, cobwebby cords of mycelium on the root surface. Woolly grey to black mycelium can
also be found on the main stem a few inches above the soil surface. Numerous small, white, star-
shaped mycelium develop on the surface of the wood, under the bark. Small black points or narrow
black strands can be seen on the surface of and embedded in wood infected with R. bunoides.

2.3 Brown Root Disease

The disease is caused by the fungus Phellinus noxius. |ts most prominent character is the crust of soil
firmly attached to the roots and which cannot easily be knocked or washed off. The presence of a
brown mycelium amongst the soil encrusting the diseased root distinguishes brown root disease from
all others. :

2.4 Charcoal Root disease

The disease is caused by Ustulina zonata and U. deusta. Roots attacked by this fungus have no
visible mycelium on their surface. However, when the bark is removed, large white or brownish white
fan-shaped patches of mycelium are seen on the wood surface. Wood is permeated by irregular
generally double black bands or lines. The fungus produces a characteristic charcoal-like, black, brittle
fructification at the collars or main stems of diseased bushes.

2.5 White Root Disease

The pathogen is Rigidoporus microporus. Roots are covered with, stout, rather flat cords of mycelium
which run more or less longitudinally and unite with one another to form a network. The mycelium is
white/yellowish when fresh they have reddish tinge. Fructifications are formed on the base- like
brackets. Semicircular in shape and reddish brown in colour. The disease is common in low county.

2.6 Violet Root Disease

This is a secondary root disease and associated with poor soil aeration and water logging conditions.
The disease is caused by Nectria mauriticola. Roots become roughened due to enlargement of
lenticels, Roots appear either inky black or light violet in colour, Under the bark purplish black flattened
mycelial strands (rhizomorphs) with characteristic veinations are found.

3. Disease Management
3.1 Cleaning of Infestation

3.1.1 Small Infected Patches

If only one or a few plants are infected, remove the dead or dying bushes and any adjoining ones that
are showing any yellowing of the foliage. Any stumps or trees found within the infested patch must
also be uprooted. The patch should be deep-forked (30 - 45 cm) and all living and dead roots up to
pencil thickness should be collected into a pile. All the bushes and any woody material uprooted in the
cleaning process must be burnt on the spot if the space is adequate. This is to prevent any possible
dissemination of infected material into uninfected areas. Only when that is not possible, the closest
possible alternative spot must be chosen for burning them.

3.1.2 Large/Several-infected Patches

A large area may be infected by the disease as one contiguous block or as several small patches of
several bushes adjacent to each other. The method of cleaning is essentially similar to that described
for cleaning of small patches. If the infected area is staggered and includes several small pockets
close to each other, it would be advisable to demarcate the entire area to include all of them into one
block.

Remove all the bushes and stumps within the demarcated area, with their roots. The patch should be
deeply forked (45-60 cm) and all the remaining roots up to pencil-thickness be collected and burnt in
situ.

If there are many large patches, do not attempt to clean all of them at once. List the bad sections and
treat them first to prevent fast spread and contamination. The entire cleaning and burning operation
needs very close supervision.
The field or patch infected with violet root should be improved through proper drainage and forking to
increase soil aeration. Overall soil conditions should be improved by organic amendments.

3.2 Treatment of Peripheral Bushes

After the infected area has been thoroughly cleaned, the two rows of bushes surrounding the patch
should be treated with a soil drench directed at the area around the collar of bushes using a suitable
fungicide (Refer Advisory Circular PU2). Fungicide should be applied when the soil is suitably moist.
Repeated applications at 2-3 month intervals up to 3-4 times must be undertaken depending on the
performance of peripheral bushes. Care should be taken to avoid surface run off at the time of
drenching treatment. It would be advantageous to loosen the soil around the plants with a hand fork
before treatment with a recommended fungicide.

If for some reason, any of the peripheral bushes develop symptoms of the disease they should be
uprooted immediately, taking all the precautions mentioned above and the adjoining bushes be
treated with a fungicide as before. This process of observation and uprooting should continue until no
more symptoms appear and the disease is not spreading any more.

3.3. Planting of Grass

When the cleaning up operation is over, the patch should be planted with Mana grass for a minimum
period of two years before planting tea.

3.4 Treatment of Infills

At the end of rehabilitation period, the patch could be planted with tea immediately followed by
drenching treatment The rate of application in the first two rounds (at 2-3 month intervals) can be at
the rate of 250 ml per plant which should be increased up to 300 - 350 ml per plant in the subsequent
two rounds. Please refer Advisory Circular PU2 for recommended fungicides

Cleaning of diseased patches should be started two years prior to pruning, so that the vacancies can
be infilled in the pruning year.

3.5 Treatment of Areas to be Replanted

The cause of death or any dying bushes in areas earmarked for uprooting for replanting with tea
should be properly identified. Any areas suspected and or confirmed to be affected by a root disease
must be demarcated and cleaned first taking all the precautions mentioned for containing the disease.
It is best that these areas are marked out for future identification so that the necessary follow up
treatments (as indicated before) can be properly undertaken after planting of tea.

ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.DMEg

 

Issued in: February 2024 Serial No. 07/24

PROTECTION OF TEA FROM RED RUST DISEASE IN THE LOW COUNTRY

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular DM 4 Serial No 13/03 issued in August 2003 and
related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 2)

1. Introduction

The Red Rust disease is caused by an alga Cephaleuros parasiticus Karst. Red Rust attacks both
young and mature teas in the low country up to an elevation of 600 m (2000 ft) ams!. Though this can
be encountered above 600 ft, it does not cause any economic damage. The disease is usually more
severe on teas that grow under sub optimal growing conditions. But occasionally vigorously growing,
high-yielding tea cultivars too have been found to be badly attacked. Diseased branches have also
been seen on old seedling bushes growing in fields with a good cover of tea. On mature tea the
disease is particularly bad on the peripheral branches, which show marked chlorosis at certain times of
the year.

By and large, the main predisposing factor appears to be shallow, quartzy soil, often accompanied by
an underlying hard pan of kabook and gravel. The disease is also severe on tea growing on ill drained
and alkaline soils. A gradual neglect of cultivation practices is also responsible for disease outbreaks.
Frequent spells of drought predispose young tea to Red Rust, especially in the early years. Inadequate
or complete absence of shade is another factor favouring the disease.

2. Symptoms and Diagnosis

Red rust causes severe damage to young tea by attacking and killing stem tissues in patches. Affected
patches on the stem become most noticeable when the alga produces its fructifications, which appear
during the month of April to July on stems up to about two years of age. These patches appear brick-
red or orange in colour. The patches are oval to oblong in shape. During August to March, the lesions
appear purplish in colour; there are no fruiting hairs at this time, but longitudinal cracks may be seen
on the surface. Severely affected stems on weak bushes die back. The leaves produced above
affected regions show a characteristic variegation with yellow or white patches, which mimics
discolourations caused by mutations that are more common at higher elevations.

The disease is also common on the older leaves. Affected patches are usually circular and are usually
about 5-7 mm in diameter. In some instances, they can be long and oval, running along the entire
length of the midrib. The damage caused to the plant by the leaf spots is negligible.

Infection takes place mostly during the fruiting period by means of spores, which are dispersed by wind
or rain. Repeated attacks gradually weaken the bush with a consequent reduction in crop. Bushes that
are severely attacked by Red Rust can be easily recognized by their scanty appearance. Such bushes
recover poorly after pruning.

3. Management of Red Rust
3.1 Cultural Methods

As Red Rust is more often serious only on weak plants, strengthening the host by good agricultural
practices should help minimize the damage caused by the disease. This could be achieved by one or
more of the following approaches.

a. By improving soil condition: If drainage is the main limiting factor, improve drainage to promote
deeper rooting. If the conditions are limited due to an underlying hard pan, deep forking will
help breaking it for the deep penetration of roots. During dry weather, thatch new clearings
with suitable mulching materials such as loppings of Guatemala or Mana Grass.

b. By improving soil fertility: Soil fertility should be improved by addition of organic amendments
and proper fertilizer applications.

3.2 Chemical Methods

Fungicidal spraying is recommended for Red Rust control. Copper fungicides have provided very good
results. For effective control, spray a fungicide as recommended in Advisory Circular PU2 about three
rounds during the year. It is suggested that for young tea, the first spray be applied in late April, the
second about four weeks later in May, and the third, in June. For good control, it is essential to wet the
green stems and the older wood with the spray solution, on which the alga is sporulating.

For mature tea, the first spray application should be given soon after pruning, the second at tipping
and third about four weeks later. It is advisable to remove all the trailing peripheral branches during
pruning. Full benefits of spraying can be achieved only if spraying is continued for two to three
successive years.

representing one of the anamorphic genus) is in common occurrence in mid and low country tea lands.

The increase in the incidence of stem canker in the low country is attributed to several factors. The
most important of them are:

¢ The prolonged periods of dry weather, experienced in the recent past. Severe attacks of
Macrophoma are normally associated with dry weather conditions.

e Planting of cultivars specially TRI 2023, TRI 2026 and TRI 4042 in tea lands with inferior soil
conditions such as gravelly and rockey.

e Planting undertaken without due attention given to soil conditions, soil rehabilitation,
establishment of shade and the use and availability of thatching materials. The association of
one or more of these factors result in the establishment of unthrifty plants in the field. When
followed by dry weather, these plants become very vulnerable to attacks by Macrophoma.

2. Symptoms and Diagnosis

The disease first appears as slightly sunken, dark patches on the red wood of branches of about pencil
thickness. These patches are usually oval, running longitudinally along the stem for a few centimeters.
The fungus kills the bark over these patches, which then turn black and soft and later separate from the
wood. The fungus is usually arrested after it kills small areas of the bark. Callus develops around the
edges of the dead patches or cankers.

In mild attacks the cankers are completely callused over within a few months. But in severe cases
callus formation is usually incomplete and the fungus may renew its activity after some months and kill
the cankered branches completely. In cankers, which have not healed over completely, fruiting bodies
(pycnidia) may be found in the dead bark tissues, which release spores that could start fresh infections.
In some cases, the bark is blackened and killed uniformly down to the base of the branch and the
disease then continues on to the main stem. The branch dies when the fungus completely encircles a
branch and if this happens at the base of the main stem the entire plant will be killed. In the affected
shoots, the leaves become yellow, wither and ultimately fall off. This type of attack is common in young
tea, which had not been cutback. The fungus Macrophoma theicola also attacks the older stems of
mature bushes and cause typical cankers. It usually attacks the upper surface of horizontal branches,
killing the bark and discoloring the wood. After some time, the dead bark peels off from the wood and
wood-rot sets in. As this takes place in the interior of the bush, the disease is not noticed until pruning
and by that time the canker may have reached an advanced state. Latent infections can be in the field
without visible canker on stems.
3. Management of Stem and Branch Cankers

It has been found that the disease cannot be controlled by the planting of resistant cultivars or by the
exclusive use of fungicides. An integrated system of control has been found to be most suitable. These
will have to be invariably combined with measures to conserve soil moisture during dry weather periods.
No tea cultivar has been found to be completely resistant to the disease under conditions of severe
moisture stress.

3.1 Cultural Methods
It is important that the incidence of the disease should be kept to a minimum, up to the time of the first
prune. Infection of the main stem and primary branches should be prevented if the plant is to survive
and be productive in the coming years. To achieve this;
In New Clearings

e Avoid planting in areas where the soil is poor (gravelly and rocky soil).

e — It is important to follow all the soil conservation measures during replanting as recommended.

e¢ Agood stand of shade should be established prior to planting tea.

e Do not undertake to replant an area larger than that can be handled.

e Before planting a new clearing, ensure that sufficient thatching material is available to
completely thatch the entire area during the dry periods.

e Please refer to Advisory Circular PN 1 for selection of cultivars that are resistant to stem and
branch canker disease.

In Mature Tea
e Asin the case of young tea, a good stand of shade will reduce the incidence of the disease.

e The disease is usually noticed at the time of pruning. This therefore is the best time to get rid of
the cankered branches.

e The cankered branches should be removed just below the canker, followed by a wound
dressing (refer Advisory Circular PU 2) of cut ends. At pruning time, attempts should be made
to remove as much cankered branches as possible. In instances where the entire bush is
affected those should be uprooted and burnt. The vacancies thus created must be supplied with
cultivars resistant to canker (refer Advisory Circular PN 1).

3.2 Chemical Methods

Any appropriate systemic fungicide together with above cultural measures have been found to be
effective in reducing the incidence of the stem and branch canker. In new clearings the fungicides
should be applied with a knapsack sprayer, from the time of planting, once in 2-3 months. The plants
should be given a drenching spray.

The pruned bushes should be sprayed with a fungicide about 2-3 times starting soon after the pruning
operation (2-3 weeks interval). The fungicide should be applied with a knapsack sprayer, to wet the
frames and branches thoroughly.
 

Spraying of systemic fungicides should be avoided in plucking fields as they leave residues in made
tea.

Mother bushes should also be treated similarly before taking cuttings for nursery. As a precaution,
cuttings should be dipped in 0.05% systemic fungicide solution before inserting into nursery bags as a
prophylactic treatment to protect nursery plants from latent infections.

PROTECTION OF TEA FROM COLLAR AND BRANCH CANKER DISEASE

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular DM 6 Serial No 21/03 issued in September 2003 and
related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 2)

1. Introduction

The fungus Phomopsis theae attacks tea plants in immature new clearings (up to 8 years) and the
tender shoots of mature seedling teas and tea cultivars, in areas over 1200 m (4000 ft) in elevation. in
all cases, infection takes place during dry weather conditions.

Collar canker and bush dieback caused by Fusarium solani species complex infects both young and
mature bushes regardless of elevation.

2. Symptoms and Diagnosis

Those bushes that are infected at the collar start to show general yellowing of the entire foliage. These
symptoms become heightened with the onset of rains when they fail to recover, compared to an
adjacent healthy bush. Upon uprooting, such plants will show near complete or complete girdling at the
collar, depending on the intensity of yellowing. This could give the impression that the disease starts
with the rains.

Infection takes place through leaf scars, wounds or directly by penetration of the bark in plants, which
are subjected to moisture stress. This is found to be more common in VP tea cultivars, which have a
shallow rooting habit, or in plants growing in unsuitable soils. Similarly, poorly developed nursery plants
having weak root systems are also prone to attack. Infections over a large area is uncommon unless
the area has poor, gravelly or clayey soil with underlying slab rock or unless very susceptible tea
cultivars are used. Infections are usually sporadic and occasional, and patchy infections are a rarity.

Cankers caused by F. solani species complex cause premature leaf yellowing and leaf fall followed by
thinning of branches. Flowering and fruiting are common on infected bushes. Irregular canker is found
at the collar region. Older cankers have raised margin. Crakes and peeling off of the bark appear at the
collar region at soil level or just below. The exposed cambium and wood were discolored giving a tan,
brown or black color. Bushes die gradually.

3. Control of Collar and Branch Cankers

An integrated system of control has been found to be the most suitable. These will have to be invariably
combined with measures to conserve soil moisture during dry weather periods. The following measures
are recommended to raise plants, which can withstand infection.

3.1 Cultural Methods
(a) Nursery Practices

It is necessary to raise healthy and uniformly grown plants in the nursery. To achieve this, the
following measures are recommended.

e Discourage use of cultivars KEN 16/3, K 145, TRI 2024, TRI 2142, TRI 3020, TRI 4067,
TRI 3073, TRI 3072 for the drier areas where Phomopsis canker is a problem.

e A ccultivar response is not prominent in collar canker and dieback caused by F. solani.

e Strictly adhere to standard planting materials.

 
 

(b) Field Practices
Land Selection
Avoid planting in unsuitable lands in steep and rocky areas, in areas with underlying slab rock,
ravines and in areas with poor drainage.
During Rehabilitation

e Examine the grass during the drought and mark out the areas where the grass is not
growing satisfactorily, particularly in patches.

¢ Determine whether such poor growth is due to underlying slab rock or poor soil by digging a
pit.
e Having determined the cause of the poor growth of grass, either ameliorate it or diversify
into grass.
During Field Planting

e It is important to prepare correct-size planting holes and follow up by correct planting, to
encourage a well distributed root system.

e Thatch the clearing with loppings of Mana, Guatemala or Eragrostis curvula.

e Avoid deep planting and accumulation of soil at base after planting.

Post-planting Operations
Apply fertilizer correctly, as recommended (see Advisory Circular SP 2).

e Protect the plants against blister blight until maturity. Entry of Phomopsis can take place
through wounds caused by stem infections due to blister blight.

e If any cankers are noticed, remove the branch just below the canker as soon as they are
noticed.

e Thatch all new clearings adequately.

3.2 Chemical Methods

As infection is always sporadic, prophylactic treatment of all plants in a clearing is not advocated to
prevent possible infection on a small number of plants. However, it has been observed that the fields,
which receive adequate controlling in blister blight, by way of fungicides, particularly the systemic ones,
to record less incidence of collar canker.

Drench the canker infected bushes with a recommended systemic fungicide at 0.05% at 2 - 4 weeks’
intervals based on severity (2-4 application is required, see refer Advisory Circular PU2).

Plants showing general yellowing of the foliage and dieback to be uprooted and burnt in situ.

MANAGEMENT OF HORSE-HAIR BLIGHT IN TEA

(This Advisory Circular cancels Guideline 1/03 issued in May 2003)

1. Introduction

Horse-hair Blight is so named because the cord of mycelium (rhizomorph), which is blackish, round
and rather stout, has a striking resemblance to the black horse hair. It is caused by the fungus
Marasmius crinis-equi which is an epiphyte (growing on the bush without deriving its nourishment
from the living tissues) seen to be growing on the branches and leaves of the tea bush. It is often
mistaken for a parasite because of the dead leaves and twigs being attached to the hair-like chords.
Besides tea, it has been recorded on nutmeg, rubber and other jungle shrubs.

2. Symptoms

Horse-hair Blight originates either from the main stem or any of the branches and the fungal strands
grow upwards, with the help of small brown pads of hyphal aggregates, crisscrossing the entire bush.
This results in a matrix of netting, in which all the debris and falling leaves are entrapped. The fungus
usually obtains its nourishment from the dead outer bark of the older tea stems as well as from the
decaying material within its entangle. The problem assumes greater dimensions towards the latter
stages of the pruning cycle, giving the bush a very unhygienic appearance. Heavily affected bushes
would generally appear to be unthrifty.

3. Occurrence and Spread

This problem is normally more prevalent in tea fields situated below 600 m elevation, possibly due to
temperature and humidity being relatively high, and hence it is considered a low-country problem.
Low lying riverbed-associated flat terrains are more conducive to this problem, even though it is also
commonly seen in shady and damp upper slopes of fields.

Though this was considered an insignificant problem in the past, mainly affecting debilitated tea,
increased incidences and intensities have been reported in recent times probably due to expansion of
tea planting into more marginal conditions. The lack of attention to details, like adequate post-prune
bush sanitation, may have permitted the few strands first noticeable to multiply to heavy proportions
over subsequent cycles. The remnants left behind at pruning would lead to a greater tangle of
mycelial threads by the end of the current cycle capable of collecting more debris and falling leaves.

Since the fungus is non-parasitic, no direct damage is done to the growing bush. However, it can
cause a heavy leaf fall and physical hindrance to operations such as plucking and pruning (more so
with mechanical pruning), the severity varying in proportion to the undisturbed age of the tangle.

4. Remedial Measures

e Maintenance of bush sanitation is of paramount importance. Cleaning of bush frames should
commence at first prune, and any black mycelial threads present should be removed
physically. Such bush sanitation, at pruning, should be practiced on all new clearings in areas
below 600 m.

e Burying the prunings and mycelial threads of the fungus.
 

e Spraying of hydrated lime on to tea bush frames should be considered mandatory after each
prune. About 1,000 L of this solution would be required to cover 1 ha of tea (Please refer
Advisory Circular PU2).

e Improving soil conditions by the addition of organic matter combined with periodic forking is
also an indispensable operation.

e Poorly drained (alluvial) soils should be provided with better drainage and aeration.

e During monsoon periods, adequate sunlight and ambient aeration should be provided by
adopting proper shade management practices.

1.Objectives
Theobjectives ofpruning teaareto:
•maintain aconvenient height oftheplucking table foreasyharvesting,
•stimulate vegetative shoot growth forsustaining productivity,
•remove old,decayed, pest-infested anddiseased branches formaintaining ahealthy frame,
•effectively utilize thelandarea, andensure economic viability ofplantations.
2. Categorization offields
Inorder toembark onabalanced andsuccessful pruning programme, itisnecessary tocategorize
teafields according totheir potential yield. Thiswillreduce theriskofcrop losses andannual
crop fluctuations. Categorization offields should beupdated periodically, taking into
consideration thenewclearings under capital, coming intobearing under revenue. Please refer
Advisory Circular No.LU2onFieldcategorization intealands fordetails.
3. Methods ofpruning
Pruning should bedone withasharp knife andthecutpreferably, bemade slanted towards the
centre ofthebush. There arefourmajor styles ofpruning, asoutlined below viz.clean, rimlung
cut-across andrejuvenation pruning. Although rimlungpruning isthemost suitable method,
other styles alsocanbeadopted under special circumstances asgiven below.
3.1 Clean Pruning
Thisisahardpruning system bywhich allthebranches arecutlowataheight of25-40 cm(10-
16""). Clean pruning usually results inlateorpoor recovery duetotheabsence offoliage and
inadequate starch reserves tosupport budbreak andsubsequent growth ofshoots.
However, clean pruning may beadopted athigh elevations, provided thesoilandweather
conditions areconducive forgrowth andadequate starch reserves areavailable intheteabush
forbetter recovery after pruning.

3.2Rimlungpruning
Inrimlungpruning, about 3to4healthy branches areleftattheperiphery ofthebush atthe
time ofpruning. These lungbranches should have inallabout 200to300leaves perbush to
enable early recovery. Therecommended height ofpruning is40-55 cm(16-22"").
3.3Cut-across pruning
Incut-across prune, thetopofthebush iscutlevelataheight ofabout 55-70 cm(22-28""). Inthis
typeofpruning, nocleaning upofolddebilitated branches ispossible andhence itcanleadto
poor frame development. With cut-across pruning, itispossible toobtain anearly crop.
Thereafter, thebushes willremain dormant forprolonged period. Old,debilitated ormarginal tea
fields thatareear-marked foruprooting ordiversification canbegiven acut-across pruning.
3.4Rejuvenation Pruning
Rejuvenation pruning isatypeofhardpruning carried outwhen thefoundation frame ofbushes
reaches anunproductive stage. Theheight ofpruning canvarydepending onthestatus ofthe
frame. Please refertothe'Advisory Circular' No.HP4onrejuvenation pruning fordetails.
3.5Skiffing
Skiffing isaslashing orleveling operation which smoothens theplucking surface andreduces its
height byafewcentimetres. Itcanbeusedtodelay arushcroportoextend thepruning cycle, if
theneed arises.

5.Time ofpruning
Pruning intheUpcountry, Mid-country (wetzone) andLowcountry regions could bedone during
ApriltoJune, after afewshowers from thesouth-west monsoon andwhen there isadequate soil
moisture. Forsome reason, ifpruning cannot bedone orcompleted during thisseason, those
fields could bepruned during September toOctober. However, highyielding fields should be
pruned during thesouth-west monsoon. Some areas inthelowcountry (Balangoda, Rakwana,
2
etc.), and inthemid-country (Matale, Upper Hewaheta, Udapussellawa regions etc.),
high-yielding teafields should bepruned during September toOctober withtheonset ofrains.
IntheUvaregions, high-yielding teafields should bepruned during October toJanuary which is
anassured season ofraininthisarea. Theremaining fields earmarked forpruning inthesame
region could bepruned during March toApril. Pruning ofafieldshould becompleted within the
shortest period oftime (within about 7days). Thisistofacilitate uniform recovery andto
complete postpruning practices intime.
Teafields should notbepruned immediately after harvesting therush crop andfollowing a
prolonged drought. These fields should berested atleastforabout 6weeks. Theperiod could be
extended inthecaseofpruning ofdebilitated bushes. Thisisextremely necessary forbuilding up
ofcarbohydrate reserves forearly andbetter recovery after pruning. Inorder toidentify fields to
berested before pruning, asimple iodine testonroots canbedone about 2-3months before
pruning.
6.Dryweather pruning
Pruning intodryweather isnotrecommended, because itmaycause sunscorch onbranches
leading towood rotandframe debilitation. Scorching alsoreduces thenumber ofnewshoots.
Dryweather pruning asameasure ofcontrolling blister blight isalsonotrecommended.
7.Bush sanitation
Thisinvolves theremoval andshaving offweak, diseased, dead orpest-infested stems and
branches torenovate thebush frame. Bush renovation should beundertaken from the1st
pruning onwards. Theindividual branches withextensive die-back, wood rot,canker andtermite
damage could bepruned lowwhile maintaining auniform height ofprune. Itispreferable to
apply arecommended wound dressing ontheprune cuts andshaved offwounds. Pruned
branches canbeprotected from sunscorch byplacing some oftheprunings overthebush for
about 3daysimmediately after pruning.
8.Mossing and Ferning
Moss andfernontheframes should becleaned manually orchemically using lime, soon after
pruning andwellbefore thecommencement ofbud-break. Hydrated limecanbesprayed onthe

9.Burying ofprunings
Inorder toenhance soilfertility, pruned branches should beretained inthefield asmulch or
buried inshallow trenches inthealternate inter-rows offlatorundulating tealands. Lopped
branches ofshade trees cutintopieces mayalsobeincorporated.
10.Removal oflung branches
Thelungs should beremoved selectively depending onthestage ofrecovery ofindividual bushes.
Thisshould tobestarted when themajority ofnewshoots have produced 3-4fullyopened

Guidelines on Plucking

Introduction

Picking of young tea shoots having two to three leaves and soft dormant shoots (banjhi) is
known as plucking. Plucking is the most labour intensive field operation in tea plantations.
Hence, the profitability of tea plantations depends to a large extent on the harvesting
policies. Well-balanced plucking policy enhances the yield and optimises the labour use
without affecting the quality of made tea.

Shoot growth and shoot generations

The production and storing of food materials take place in all growing shoots and growth of
a bush depends on such food materials. Plucking removes a greater part of shoots that are
in the process of production. The degree of removal of growing shoots can affect the
growth and yield of a tea bush. In order to optimise the shoot growth, it is very essential to
understand the functions or the importance of different growing stages of a tea shoot.

Growth of shoots

e After plucking, shoot growth starts from the axillary buds just below the point of
plucking. There is a potential for a number of axillary buds to commence growth
after apical growth is interrupted by plucking. But the first axillary bud immediately
below the plucking point usually grows first.

e Initially, two small appendages known as scale leaves, which cover the bud, open
out. They generally fall off few days after opening. Then another one or two,
medium sized, unserrated, blunt leaves are unfolded above these scale leaves. The
smaller one immediately above the scale leaves is termed janam leaf and the other
one is called the fish leaf.

e Then the bud starts to produce normal leaves which are commonly included in the
harvest.

e After unfurling 4-5 leaves, the terminal bud becomes inactive, and passes through a
dormant (resting) period known as banjhi or wangi.

e The growth pattem having alternate active and dormant growing phases is termed
as periodicity of growth.

¢ Initiation of the axillary bud growth is rather slow. It enters into a fast growing period
after unfurling the janam/fish leaf. This is generally known as linear phase of
growth.

¢ Shoot weight, approximately, doubles at the opening of each extra leaf, on a shoot
reaching the harvestable size, i.e. with 2-3 flush leaves.

Shoot generations

There are number of shoots of different growth stages in a tea bush. i.e. growing buds, bud
and scale leaves, bud and fish leaf, etc., A group of shoots of the same growth stage or age
is called a generation. The generations are formed as a result of variation in shoot growth
and frequent harvesting. Continuous plucking is possible as there are large number of
shoots belonging to different generations in a tea bush. The number of generations usually
increases with shortening of the plucking round. Increase in shoot generations helps to
increase the shoot population density, which is the major yield component

Growing buds and immature shoots (animbus) on a plucking table are considered major
sites for storing carbohydrates (sink) produced by mature leaves (source). Hence, it is
essential to ensure that the immature shoots are left on the bush after plucking.
Leaf standard (Plucking standard)
This refers to the composition of standard flush/eaf of the harvested crop.
Standard (acceptable) flush/eaf means;

Shoots with two tender leaves & bud

Immature dormant shoots

Shoots with three tender leaves & bud

Immature shoots and coarse leaf are unacceptable.

 

Percentage of standard flush Leaf Standard

More than 75% Fine Plucking
60- 75% Medium Plucking

Less than 60 % Coarse Plucking

        
    
        

Plucking coarse leaves will lead to drop in the quality of made tea.

Plucking style (Severity of plucking)

This refers to the point at which a shoot is plucked. The appropriate plucking style should
be selected depending on the prevailing weather pattem, bush vigour and labour
availability.

A well-planned plucking policy with a combination of light and hard plucking during different
seasons, by maintaining a good canopy depth, should be carried out.

Os Plucking or Fish leaf Just above the fish leaf. Fish leaf & scale leaves.

Plucking round/Frequency of plucking

Plucking round is the number of days between successive plucking.

An ideal plucking round is the number of days taken between successive openings of
leaves on a shoot. This period is called leaf period or phyllochron.

The rate of shoot growth depends on factors such as weather & type of clone.
Plucking rounds become shorter during wet weather while it is extended during dry
weather. Therefore, the plucking rounds should also be determined accordingly.
Maintaining a proper plucking round that matches the rate of shoot growth helps to
increase the yield and to minimize a drop in the quality of made tea.

Haphazard extended plucking rounds may not only lower the made tea quality, but
also reduce the yield.

Plucking rounds and the plucking standards are independent factors.

Extended rounds may influence the plucking standards due to high percentage of
over-mature shoots.

Plucking and vigour of the bush

The tea leaf attains the highest photosynthetic activity when they reach half their
final size. It remains at the maximum for about 6 month from full expansion.
Usually the life span of a tea leaf is about 18 months.

This shows that the older leaves do not contribute to the production because production
decreases with ageing of leaves. Therefore, addition of new foliage on the canopy by
plucking to a mother leaf for about 6 months per year is required.

Continuous mother leaf plucking leads to the unnecessary rise in the plucking table.
Maintenance of a thick canopy (more than 25 cm) is not required, as leaves at the
bottom layers of the canopy do not receive sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis.
Depth of maintenance foliage is less in young tea and in pruned tea. Hence,
adoption of mother leaf plucking is necessary to build up adequate leaf canopy.

Fish leaf plucking could be done during the cropping months, while resorting to
mother leaf plucking during the balance periods is recommended.

.Hard plucking will give a higher yield initially, but continuous hard plucking will result

in debilitation of the bush and an increase in the formation of mudichchies (crow's
feet condition).

Continuous hard plucking or light plucking systems will bring about low productivity of
the bush. It is therefore, important to adopt a mixture of two plucking systems
depending on the prevailing weather condition in the area, the age from pruning and
bringing into bearing practices.

Mechanical harvesting

Mechanical harvesting should be sought if the hand plucking is impractical due to the
scarcity of labour. Under such conditions TRI Selective Tea Harvester could be used.

Plucking table should be even and it should follow the slope of the land. This should
be initiated from the time of pruning/tipping and continued with the bush creep.
Removal of banji and crow’s-feet should be a routine practice.

Immature shoots (arimbus) must be left unplucked to be taken at the next round as
heavier units.

Coarse leaves and stalks should be removed in the field to maintain a better leaf
standard and a plucking table.

Shoots on side branches and hollows on the plucking table should be left unplucked
until they cover the open spaces.

Pluckers should be instructed not to ram the flush into their baskets.

Pluckers should be instructed not to retain an excessive number of plucked
shoots in their hands.

Plucking on the rested bushes and on the ‘lungs’ of pruned bushes should be
avoided.

Possible damages to plucked shoots at the point of weighing, bulking and
transporting should be minimized.

Education of pluckers and careful supervision on plucking will ensure the quality of
made tea

CULTIVATION OF TEA SOILS - FORKING
(This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No. S 1, Serial No. 5/71)
1. Introduction

The continuous growing of a single crop causes deterioration of soil physical properties.
This may be at a maximum in a tea field with a poor bush density. The soil surface
between tea rows are subjected to continual treading due to the movement of workers
to harvest crop as well as to perform other cultural operations. This treading creates
compaction of the surface layer, which in turn impedes the entry of rainwater causing
run-off of most of the rain falling on the surface. The entry of air through the surface
pores is also restricted thereby, causing a deficit of oxygen, that is most necessary for
vigorous root growth. When infiltration of rainwater is low and run-off is high, the fertilizer
applied will be washed away with the run-off water, thus causing wastage of costly
fertilizer.

2. Method of Soil Cultivation

To break up such compaction and aerate the soil, the type of soil cultivation
recommended is termed ""forking"". The objective of forking is to ensure deep cultivation
of soil in a mild degree.

Forking could be carried out in the inter-row spaces both in VP and Seedling tea. In the
case of seedling fields which is planted up and down the slope, forking could be carried
out in a staggered manner.

While forking, the soil is opened up, at the center of the inter-row space, without turning
over the clod and with minimum of disturbance to the feeder roots. Deep forking is
undertaken with a garden fork having 3-4 tines, 38-45 cm long, which is forced in to the
ground at a nearly vertical angle up to a depth of 38-45 cm. The handle of the fork is
then pushed forward so as to open up a pocket behind the tines. The fork is then
withdrawn when the operation is called “plain forking”; or else the ground litter, green
manure loppings and such other materials (compost, well decomposed tea waste etc)
are pushed into the pocket created, in which case it is called “envelope forking”. This
operation is repeated at intervals of about 22-30 cm apart.

3. Forking in Relation to Weather

Forking during prolonged dry weather should be avoided. When forking is carried out in
such dry periods, the soil surface is exposed to wind and sun resulting in increased
evaporation of soil water. It is also advisable to avoid forking during heavy rains, as soils
of unstable crumb structure tend to puddle very readily.
4. Frequency and Time of Forking

4.1 Frequency of Forking: It is recommended that forking be carried out only
once a cycle in the up and mid-country, and once in two cycles in the low-
country. However, where low-country tea soils are known to be clayey and
compacted, the flexibility to fork once a cycle may be allowed.

4.2 Time of Forking: Though forking is normally done after pruning, the best
time to undertake when there is sufficient new foliage on the bush and adequate
soil moisture, and this would be around tipping time.

Forking could also be spread over two intervals, when alternate rows are forked
each time. The first round may be undertaken as described above, while the
second round may be given mid-cycle, but at the latter time there would be
insufficient space between two rows for comfortable worker movement.

5. Economics of Forking

The benefits of improving soil physical properties and water percolation into the soil
through forking cannot always be calculated in physical terms, but it could be assumed
to reflect in the yield. Recent research indicated that, over a 4-year cycle, forking can
give a net incremental yield of about 20%, compared to the control. This analysis, whilst
indicating the profitability of the operation of forking should not be taken out of context
and generalized. Research data is applicable only to the specific set of conditions (slope,
soil, rainfall and microclimate) operating in a given field yet could be taken to serve as an
indicator of the economic advantages that could accrue through forking.

GUIDELINES ON LAND SUITABILITY CLASSIFICATION FOR TEA

The selection of land according to its suitability has become increasingly important in
making the best use of available land for tea cultivation. It is not appropriate for a
single set of norms to be established for all tea-growing areas, since this will not take
into account regional differences caused by variations in elevation and climate, which
are likely to exert a strong influence on land suitability.

The term “land” includes many attributes such as climate, topography, soil and its
genesis, vegetation, the presence of soil microorganisms and the effects of human
activity. Land can be classified according to its agricultural suitability. Performance of
lands, under different management systems, can be predicted. The potential and
limitations of land intended for tea-growing can be determined by its physical, chemical
and biological features.

Land classification can simplify management and decision-making on new planting,
replanting, infilling, diversification and conservation of tea lands. It also helps to assess
the long-term production trends and investment needs for enhanced productivity.

There are many factors that determine land suitability for tea. The most important
factors are climate, slope, soil depth, surface rockiness and gravel content. Certain of
these factors could be limiting factors. A simplified !and suitability classification for tea

can be based on limitations imposed by these factors and their interactions (Tables 1a
and 1b).

Methodology for Assessing the Limiting Factors

1. The slope of the land is measured using a clinometer.

2. The surface rockiness of the land is estimated by measuring the extent covered
by rocks and boulders in the total land area.

3. The soil depth is measured by digging at random a minimum of 12 pits per ha
to a depth of 1 m (Figure 1).

Issued in: September 2003 Serial No: 16/03

FIELD CATEGORIZATION IN TEA LANDS
(This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No. E 1, Serial No. 12/94)
1. Introduction

An estate comprises of numerous fields, often separated from each other by natural
boundaries such as ravines and footpaths or man-made boundaries such as wind belts
and fences. A given field is generally planted in one year and in an extent that can be
handled by one gang of pluckers. Some fields would be high yielding while others may
not be so, and hence the contribution of each field to total estate crop will vary. Records
of crop harvested, workers utilized, fertilizer applied, cultural operations etc., are
maintained individually for each field. This information could be advantageously
exploited for planning a development program, for the estate as a whole by relating
inputs to field productivity.

2. Basis of Categorization

Categorization is based on the performance of each field, which would generally be
dependent on topography, microclimate, soil fertility, any pest and disease incidence,
and any other constraints that may prevail. As crop harvested is the most reliable
indicator of all such factors, the productivity (yield per unit area) potential of each field
can be utilized to categorize them.

In order to even out variations that may exist (weather, inputs, worker efficiency etc) over
successive years, field categorization should be based on the average yield achieved
over the past 2 - 3 pruning cycles. The cycle lengths in all fields on an estate/division
should, as far as possible, be constant.

Generally tea fields on each plantation can be categorized into three equal categories of
“A”, “B” and “C’, based on their average annual yields over the past 2-3 pruning cycles.

3. Computation of Yield
In order to arrive at a system of categorization the following steps are necessary:

3.1. Obtain yield records for the last 2 or 3 completed pruning cycles from the yield
book. The first year of the cycle refers to the first 12 months since pruning, the
second year from the 13"" to the 24"" month and so on.

3.2. Calculate the mean yield per unit area per year (YPH) of each pruning cycle as
follows:

Mean cycle yield (kg /ha/year) = Total production over the fullcycle x 12
Total Numbr of Months in the cycle
3.3. Construct a table with 5 columns as follows:

CATEGORIZATION OF FIELDS

 

(1) (2) (3) (4) ‘| (5) |
YPH of field Field No. Extent (ha) Cumulative Remarks
(decreasing Extent (Age of field

order ) _| (ha) etc)

 

 

 

 

: t

 

: |

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.4. To divide the estate into three categories, see which entry in column 4 comes
closest to 1/3 the estate extent and draw a horizontal line entry across the table. All
fields above this line will fall into “A” Category. Similarly, separate out “B” and “C’”
categories by drawing a horizontal line across the table below the entry where the
entry in column 4 is closest to 2/3"" of the total extent.

3.5 After categorizing the fields as above, it is necessary to undertake a thorough
study of each field and shift any field, either up or down, based on whether they have
undergone any significant changes which merit such a shift (including extreme
weather periods, amalgamation of fields, crop etc).

3.6 Field categorization may also be undertaken for each division of the estate
separately if there are distinct differences in cycle lengths due to differences in
elevation.

3.7 Where there is a significant proportion of VP tea, then VP tea and old seedling
tea could be advantageously categorized separately, as their cycle lengths would
be invariably different from each other.

4. Features of the different categories

4.1. “A” Category Fields: These would be the best one-third of the fields on the
given plantation, and would have best stand of tea. Most of the VP tea will be
included in this category based on the assumption that their potential yield is high.
For some years to come, the plantation has to depend on this category of tea as the
bulk of the crop is obtained from these fields. All the inputs should be given without
restrictions. The vacancies must be infilled after each prune, to maintain such tea in
good condition. Such lands will not be replanted for a long time to come.

4.2. “B” Category Fields: The yield would be relatively poorer than ""A"" category.
Replanting/infilling could commence in the lowest yielding fields in this category,
provided there are no soil limitations.
4.3. “C” Category Fields: These fields would consist of the poorest one-third of the
tea on the plantation. These fields could be earmarked for diversification if they are
poor. Where there are no major limitations, this category could be replanted/infilled.
Other fields where lands are steep and soils are eroded, can be diversified away
from tea.

5. Advantages of Categorization

The main benefit is the prioritization of funds into productive fields, particularly when
funds aré limited, to obtain maximum returns from limited resources. When fertilizer is in
short supply, or curtailment of expenditure is necessitated due to budgetary constraints,
we could optimize inputs in better fields to attain maximum benefits, and restrict them to
relatively poor fields rather than impose a standard cut all round. In a manner similar to
the restriction of inputs, priorities could also be more clearly laid down for efficient and
cost-effective worker utilization for various cultural operations.

Categorization is most useful in maintaining the estate production uniformly from one
year to other. In order to achieve this objective, it is essential to prune equal extents in
each of the categories, say, on a 4 year cycle, one would prune a fourth of each
category.

For replanting, a long term program could be prepared to replace the tea in fields at the
bottom of “B” category as well as those at the top of “C” category, where there are no
major limitations. A critical examination must be undertaken on each selected field to
determine the cause for low yields. Replanting should be considered only if soil
conditions are suitable, without much erosion.

It is only natural that there are deaths in tea fields from time to time and if not replaced
according to a regular program of infilling, then productivity of such fields will decline
steadily. Infilling should commence with the “A” category fields, consisting of all VP tea
and the best seedling tea, and thereafter the better “B” category fields. The poorer “B”
category fields, if they are to be retained for some years to come, may be infilled if funds
and material availability permit. Infilling generally would not be desirable in lower “C’”
category fields as soil conditions may be too poor for good growth of infills.

6. Conclusion

Categorization is a dynamic system as it depends on the development of fields relative
to one another in a given estate. When a replanted field comes into bearing, it gets into
the “A” category, thereby pushing the lowest “A” category field into “B” category and the
lowest “B” category field into “C” category. So, some of the marginal tea lands low down
in the “C” category could be considered for diversification away from tea. These two
instances would alter the category of some fields, indicating that categorization is not a
once-and for-all exercise and has to be reviewed/revised periodically.

issued in: February 2001 Serial No. 1/04
BRINGING YOUNG TEA INTO BEARING

(This Circular cancels the Circular No. R1, Serial No. 24/71 issued in July 1971.)

1. Objectives

The objectives of bringing young tea into bearing is to form a low spreading bush with a dense
canopy that will result in as many plucking points as possible and also enable convenient
harvesting. Accordingly, it aims at modifying the growth of a single-stemmed plant into a multi-
stemmed bush with sturdy branches. This is sometimes referred to as bush formation. To
achieve this goal, the plants should be subjected to minimum stress.

As a result of the formation of an early ground cover, a successful bringing into bearing
operation leads to early plucking, retards weed growth and also facilitates soil conservation. It
must, however, be noted that the root growth of young plants can be adversely affected and
easily succumb to drought, if they are brought into bearing very early.

2. Methods

There are two methods of bringing young tea into bearing. They are cut-across and bending
and pegging. The practice of bending and pegging is discouraged for reasons of frame
debilitation arising fram sun scorch, canker and wood rot. The more suitable method of bringing
young tea into bearing is cut-across, and this is also known as centering.

3. Cut-across (Centering)

« Plants are allowed to be well established in the field and grow as healthy plants with
a strong leader and lateral branches, for a period of 9-12 months.

« The main stem is cut at a height of 20-25 cm from ground level, depending on the
branching habit of the cione, leaving as many side branches as possible.

e After a lapse of about 4-6 months, a second cut is given at a height of 35-40 cm
across ail branches. .

* Once the plant is adequately regenerated, shoots are tipped at a height of 45-50 cm
and the mini bush is brought inte light plucking.

A sharp knife or a secateur can be used for these operations. While centering is done,
peripheral branches or horizontally growing side shoots should not be removed so that an early
ground cover is established. Dry periods should be avoided for centering to minimize
environmental stress on bud break and subsequent growth of shoots.

DRouGHT MiticaTion IN TEA PLANTATIONS
(This circular cancels the circular No. PA 2 serial No. 2/01 issued in January 2001)

Drought is a serious environmental hazard. Its damage to cultivated crops has become frequent in the
recent past and tea is no exception. Most of the tea growing regions in Sri Lanka receive rains from both
north-east and south-west monsoons. However, tea plantations are adversely affected by moisture stress
conditions due to uneven distribution of rainfall within the year. The main dry period in most of the tea
growing regions extends from early January to about late March. However, those areas which receive
mainly the north-east monsoon rains, viz. Uva and some parts of the Low and Mid country, have the rain
dry period generally extending from late June to about early September.

During these dry months, considerable damage can be caused to both young and mature tea, with extensive
casualties being observed in young clonal! tea during their first and the second year after planting. In order
to minimize such damage and ensure early recovery, the following precautionary measures need to be
adopted prior to, and following, a drought. The drought effects differ with the growth stage of tea that is
whether it is young tea (before first pruning) or mature tea (after first pruning). Hence drought mitigation
measures also should vary according to the stage of growth of the tea.

1. New clearings - tea before the first proper prune

1.1 Measures to be adopted before and during drought
1.1.1 Mulching

The inter-rows of new clearings should be thatched with Guatemala or Mana grass well before
the monsoon tails off. For this purpose, about 37.5 metric tons per hectare (15 tons per acre)
fresh material would be required. This could be obtained from a single lopping from one
hectare of well-tended grass clearing. Partially decomposed waste materials such as sawdust,
paddy husk and refuse tea can be used (at the rate of 15 - 20 tons/ ha) for mulching. They can
be applied as a layer 1"" - 2"" thick, leaving about 6"" - 8"" from the base of the tea plants. If
paddy husk or saw dust are used, they should be mixed or sprayed with urea at the rate of 2
- 3 kg per 100 kg of material. Mulching should be repeated 2 - 3 times a year depending on the
rate of decomposition of the material used.

1.1.2 Weed control
New clearings should be kept free of weeds during drought. Hence, weeding program should
be completed before the onset of the drought. If weeds are present during the drought, they
can be slashed down to minimize competition for soil moisture. As plants are under moisture
stress, spraying of any herbicide during drought is not recommended.

1.1.3 Spraying of Sulphate of potash (SOP) or Muriate of potash (MOP) and Kaolin
In order to reduce transpiration by the leaves, 2% SOP or 2% MOP can be sprayed (at the
rate of 2 kg/ ha in 100 L of water during 1* year, 4 kg/ ha 200 L of water during 2"" year and 8
kg/ ha in 400 L of water during 3"" year) using a knapsack sprayer. Spraying should commence
at least a month prior to the onset of drought and continue at 2 - 4 week intervals depending
on the severity of drought. Urea can also be mixed (2 kg/ ha) with SOP or MOP to enhance K
absorption. In plucking fields, spraying should be done immediately after harvesting of flush
to ensure proper deposition of spray droplets on mature foliage. Drenching of foliage should
be avoided since the drip would cause leaf scorch.

Spraying of Kaolin (5 - 10 kg of Kaolin in 100 L of water) on to the leaves of young tea plants
reduces heat and water loss by transpiration. Spraying should be done soon after drought sets
in.

1.1.4 Irrigation
If water is available, irrigate first year plants at 4 - 7 day intervals with 400 - 500 mi/ plant/
application. The volume should be doubled for the second year plants irrigating them at 7 - 10
day intervals.

1.1.5 Skiffing
If the drought is prolonged and the plants remained wilted in the morning hours, young tea in
their second to fourth year from planting can be partially defoliated by giving a light skiff to
remove the top most 2"" - 3"" of foliage. ,

1.1.6 Fertilizer application
Fertilizer applications should be avoided during dry weather.

1.1.7 Green manure crops
SALT hedge rows and other green manure crops inter-planted with tea should be lopped.
Cover-crops should be cut back to ground level before the onset of a drought.

1.1.8 Pest Control
Mites, tea tortrix, nettle grubs are the common dry weather pests. Outbreaks of dry weather
pests can cause considerable damage to tea plants (Please refer TRI Advisory Circulars on
pest control for their management).

1.2 Measures to be adopted following a drought
1.2.1 Fertilizer application
Young tea fertilizers should be applied only after the plants have fully recovered from moisture
stress and once the new leaves of defoliated plants are fully opened.

1.2.2 Bringing into bearing and plucking
Bringing into bearing should be done selectively and only after the plants have fully recovered
from moisture stress and the severely affected plants have fully refoliated. Second to fourth
year plants in plucking should be harvested only after they have fully recovered from moisture
stress and resumed flushing. Light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) should be resorted to during
the first.few months.

Bushes which are severely affected by drought (defoliated) should be rested until they form a
healthy canopy.

1.2.3 Resupplying
It is necessary to give priority for resupplying the vacancies before undertaking any normal
replanting programme scheduled for the year. If drought casualties are found in isolated patches,
2
it is important to identify reasons. If soil is found to be unsuitable i.e. very shallow or gravelly,
resupplying can be done in trenches (30 cm wide and 45 cm deep) which had been filled with
compost and allowed to settle for sometime.

2. Mature Tea

2.1 Measures to be adopted before and during drought
2.1.1 Plucking
It is recommended that light plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) be practiced during the drought.

2.1.2 Spraying of Sulphate of Potash (SOP) or Muriate of Potash (MOP)

In order to mitigate drought damage in mature tea by reducing water losses through
transpiration, particularly in drought prone areas, foliar application of SOP or MOP prior to
anticipated drought, is recommended. A 2% solution of SOP or 2% solution of MOP (8 kg in
400 L of water/ ha) to be applied using a knapsack sprayer at fortnight intervals, commencing
at least one month prior to the onset of drought and continue at 2 - 4 week intervals depending
on the severity of drought. 2% Urea (8 kg/ ha) can also be mixed with SOP or MOP to
enhance K absorption. Spraying should be done immediately after harvesting to ensure proper
deposition on mature foliage. Drenching of foliage should be avoided since the drip would
cause leaf scorch.

2.1.3 Skiffing
If bushes show symptoms of wilting in the morning, they can be partially defoliated by giving
a light skiff to remove the topmost 2"" - 3"" of foliage (below the kolunthu mudichchu).

2.1.4 Pruning
As a rule, pruning should not be carried out just prior to or during a drought. Dry weather
pruning can result in extensive bush debilitation.

2.1.5 Forking
This operation should be avoided during or just prior to the onset of a drought as it would
accelerate loss of soil moisture.

2.1.6 Weeding
Fields should be kept free of. weeds during a drought. Hence, the weeding programme should
be completed before the onset of drought. If weeds are present during drought, they can be
slashed down to minimize competition with the tea for soil moisture. Spraying of herbicides
during dry weather is not recommended.

2.1.7 Green manure crops and grasses
All SALT hedge rows and rehabilitation grasses planted in vacant patches in mature tea lands
should be lopped prior to a drought.

2.1.8 Pest control
Mites, tea tortrix, nettle grubs are the common dry weather pests. Outbreaks of dry weather
pests can cause considerable damage to tea bushes (Please refer to TRI Advisory Circulars
on pest control series for their management).
2.2 Measures to be adopted following a drought
2.2.1 Fertilizer application
Mature tea bushes affected by drought should be fertilized only after they have fully recovered
from moisture stress, i.e. when bushes commence flushing. It is also imperative that the
fertilizer application for defoliated bushes is delayed until they have fully refoliated and the
first set of new leaves are fully expanded.

2.2.2 Plucking
In any given field the tea bushes are subjected to varying degrees of drought damage. Light
plucking (Mother-leaf plucking) should be adopted until such time that flushing resumes its
normal periodicity.

2.2.3 Pruning
Pruning of drought affected fields should be delayed until the bushes have fully recovered
and produced sufficient foliage. It is also best to rest drought affected fields until adequate
root reserves have been accumulated.

2.2.4 Resupplying vacancies
Having infilled the new clearing areas, the best of the remaining nursery plants should be
used to supply vacancies in mature tea fields. Vacancies in seedling tea shouid be planted
with an appropriate soit reconditioning grass and infilled after a lapse of two years.

3. Other considerations
All grass clearings must be lopped prior to a drought to prevent fire hazards. However, shade trees
should not be lopped during dry weather.

ADVISORY CIRCULAR No. PARE

 

Issued in: September 2003 Serial No. 19/03

INFILLING VACANCIES IN TEA FIELDS
(This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No. E2, Serial No. 2/92)
1. Introduction

‘Infilling' is a cultural operation undertaken in tea lands to replace those bushes that die
due to various causes, with new healthy and robust plants so as to give a uniform cover
and thereby, maximise productivity. Death of plants occur periodically in tea fields due
to unfavorable climatic conditions, lightening, soil variability, pest and disease attack,
drastic cultural operations such as hard pruning and competition from neighbouring
plants. If the dead or weak plants are not replaced on time, productivity of the field will
decline and ultimately become uneconomic. The presence of vacant patches in tea
fields may also lead to the deterioration of the soil due to erosion and collapse of soil
structure. Infilling should be carried out continuously (at every prune) in order to
maintain productivity at the highest possible level. Provision should be made each year
for the envisaged infilling program which would be based on the area to be pruned and
the percent vacancies. The cost of infilling could be recovered in the first cycle of the
infills depending on the price of made tea.

2. Selection of areas for Infilling

For purposes of infilling, fields could be classified into three groups based on their
performance.

Group 1: Fields to be replanted in the.near future (within next:2-3: cycles)

Group 2: Fields not earmarked for replanting in the near future: (longer than 2-3 ¢ycles)

Group 3: Fields with poor, steep and rocky areas earmarked'for diversification away
from tea.

It will be clear that no useful purpose will be served by infilling vacancies in Groups 1
and 3. Attention should therefore be focussed on Group 2.

Fields to be infilled should be selected two years prior to pruning and the weak
(passengers) bushes in the periphery of the vacant patches must be uprooted. The
causes for the weakness of such plants must be identified and appropriate remedial
measures adopted to correct them. Thereafter, the patch should be planted with
Mana/Guatemala/Vetiver grass till the field is ready for pruning. Infilling with new plants
of high yielding or compatible cultivars can be undertaken after prune. Soil
amelioration/reconditioning under grass would improve the soil and also prevent weed
growth. The grass should be lopped periodically and the loppings used as thatch insitu.

Infilling could be carried out in small patches or large blocks. The smaller patches may
contain single or multiple infills.
3. Time of Infilling

Infilling vacancies could be easily carried out in pruned fields. Pruning in fields due for
large scale infilling should be advanced to early part of the season so that by the time
the vacancies are being supplied, the prunings left in the field will not be a hindrance. It
is not advisable to delay the operation of infilling until after all the new clearing work is
completed. Supplies must be put out as early as possible. In the Western sector it
should be with the onset of the South-West Monsoon and in the Eastern sector with the
onset of the North-East Monsoon.

It is emphasised that young supplies have to compete for water and nutrients with
surrounding. mature bushes, unlike in clearings where competition is with plants of
comparable age and size. It is essential therefore, that every possible assistance be
given to enhance the establishment and growth of the supplies especially in the case of
single or multiple infills in small patches.

4. Where Not to Infill

» Areas with underlying slab rock/hard pan.
= Ravines.
« Water logged areas.

Note: Infilling could be carried out in China jat fields with compatible cultivars.
5. Infilling of Pest and Disease affected areas

5.1. Eradication of Pest and Disease affected areas: The cause of vacancies
should be identified before embarking on an infilling program. The vacancies
caused by nematode infestation, root diseases and up-country live wood termite
are problems connected with soil. These problems are confined to well defined
patches and should therefore be identified in time and isolated as blocks by
demarcation.

5.2 Such blocks should be rehabilitated with grass after thorough up-rooting. If
these infested patches are to be identified after up-rooting, it may at times be
difficult to do so.

6. Plants used for Infilling
6.1. Selection of Cultivars for Infilling

Up-country: TRI 2025, N2, DT1, K145, TRI 3072, TRI 3073,
PK 2 (for Nuwara Eliya), DT 95. CY9, DN
Mid-country: TRI 2025,DG 7, DG 39,N 2, TRI 4042, TRI 4046.
Low-country: S 106, DG 7,DG 39, TRI 2025, TRI 2026, TRI 2027, TRI 4042
TRI 4049, TRI 4052, TRI 4059, KP 204
6.2 Size of Plants for Infilling

Raise plants in large polythene bags 15 cm (lay flat) x 30 cm

Use well grown healthy plants and not what is left over in the nursery after
planting the clearings.

The planting of cuttings should be advanced to have plants ready in the
planting season. Use around 15 month-old plants in the Up-country, 12-
month old plants in the Mid-country and 9-month old plants at low-
elevations. The planting of the cuttings should be accordingly advanced to
have the plants ready in the planting season

7. Preparation of the Field for Infilling

Fork up ail areas to be infilled, with particular emphasis on patches left
vacant for sometime, to enhance root growth of young plants as well as
to remove any pieces of old tea roots.

Vacant areas should be planted with grasses until the field is pruned and
infilling commences.

Dig large holes, 30cm in diameter and 60cm in depth.

Adopt appropriate prophylactic measures in eelworm affected areas.

In order to avoid cultural and management problems, it is suggested that
infills in large blocks in old seedling tea fields be planted along the
existing rows except when replanting is envisaged in the near future.

It may be advisable to prune the adjoining bushes slightly lower (18""), to
ensure early establishment of infills.

8. Aftercare

The infills should be protected by pegging, or with a small basket so that
workers do not trample the plants while doing other cultural operations.
Bringing into bearing should be practiced at the correct time.

The side branches of adjacent bushes should be cut in order to permit
sufficient light to reach the young supplies.

Fertilizer should be applied as for young VP tea plants.

The area should be kept weed free and thatched with an organic mulch.
Avoid use of herbicides infilled patches up to the first prune.

SAMPLING FOR SHOT- HOLE BORER ASSESSMENT

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PM 1 Serial No. 1/03 issued in February 2003
and related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 4 and PM 2)

It is essential to estimate the infestation level of Shot-hole borer (SHB) (Xyleborus fornicatus
Eichh.), synonym. Euwallacea fornicatus when tea fields are infested with SHB, before deciding
on the appropriate control measures.

1. When to Sample

Immature fields: Sampling should be carried out just prior to first formative prune.

Mature fields: Sampling should be carried out in the final year of the pruning cycle.

2. How to Sample

Sampling should be carried out in one hectare block separately. Blocks could be demarcated by
natural boundaries such as roads, paths, ravines, drains, shade trees efc., wherever possible
(Figure 1).

   
 

Block 2
100 units per {ha

   
   
    
    

Block 1

Block 7

   

Block 6

Block 5

Figure 1: Division of a Field into Blocks for sampling

Sampling should cover the whole extent of the block to obtain a representative sample. It should
comprise 100 standard units per ha, taking not more than one unit per bush. If there is more than
one cultivar in a given field each cultivar should be assessed separately.

3. Standard Units

Having selected a bush at random, remove a primary branch arising from the pruned stem that
would give a piece of stem 10 cm in length. This piece of stem is referred to as a ‘standard unit’.
The selection of the branches should be at random and no attempt be made to select only those
showing signs of galleries.

 
 

 

The standard units should be split open and examined for galleries (Figure 2). When estimating
the incidence of gallery making, one should bear in mind that the number of galleries per sample
unit is immaterial. The unit that has one or more galleries is considered as a single infested unit.

If there is more than one cultivar in a given field each cultivar should be assessed separately

\

A unit with no galleries (not galleried)
A unit with two galleries (galleried)

4. Aunit with three galleries (galleried)

Number of galleried units = 3
4. Estimation of Infestation

The standard units should be split open and examined for the presence of galleries. The
percentage incidence (as percentage gallery making) of gallery making (G%) is calculated as
follows:

G% = No. of galleried units x 100
Total no. of units sampled

5. Recommendations

the field based on above recommendations.

MANAGEMENT OF SHOT-HOLE BORER

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PM 2 with Serial No. 02/03 issued in February 2003
and related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 4 and PM 1)

1. Introduction

Shot-hole borer (SHB) (Xyleborus fornicatus Eichh.), synonym. Euwallacea fornicatus occurs in all
tea-planting regions in Sri Lanka and is one of the key insect pests in elevations between 150 m to
1500 m. However, it also appears in elevations outside this range as a pest.

Immature Tea: The main stems and main branches of immature tea are susceptible to SHB.
Protection of the main stem and main branches which give rise frame of the tea bush is vital.

Mature Tea: The immediate and direct damage that could result from heavy shot-hole borer
infestation is due to breakage of primary branches arising from prune cuts. In the case of a new
branch, after pruning, the basal section reaches the particular maturity that is preferred by the
borer from about the 12"" - 14"" month. Such a branch generally remains susceptible to attack till
about 36 months depending on the growth of the branch. Therefore, this period of primary branch
susceptibility warrants protection from borer infestation.

Formation of Wood Rot: It is important to prevent wood-rot formation in the stems that have been
galleried by the borer. Microbial organisms that cause wood-rot enter through the unhealed gallery
openings as well as through the galleries exposed by pruning. Unless removed at the pruning time
such rotted wood can, in the long run, cause protracted debilitation of the bush frame resulting in
crop loss.

2. Integrated Management of Shot-hole Borer

The following Integrated Pest Management strategies can be adopted to overcome the shot-
hole borer damage.

2.1 Planting of Tolerant Cultivars to Shot-hole Borer

There is hardly any cultivar that is totally resistant to shot-hole borer. The mostly one can do is to
select cultivars that show tolerance to shot-hole borer and a high innate capacity for callusing.
Those that have shot-hole borer tolerance exhibit compensatory growth to a great extent. Those
with high callusing properties have the ability to heal the wounds faster than others. If the wounds
heal fast, there is no opportunity for wood-rot organisms to act on the dead cells of the wounds.
However, both these factors (callusing and compensatory growth) can interrupt physiological
activity in the main stem and retard the growth of the plant.

Refer to the Advisory Circular PN 1 to select tolerant cultivars appropriate to the region/s.
2.2 Field Planting of Shot-hole Borer Uninfested Nursery Plants

Shot-hole borer uninfested nursery plants should be used for field planting.

 
2.3 Sanitary Measures at Pruning

Prune-time sanitation measures should be adopted from the first proper pruning onwards to
minimize wood rot that is induced by borer galleries. The dead snags (dieback that has undergone
wood-rot) should be removed until healthy tissue underneath is exposed. Galleried parts of a
branch should be shaved away until a clean prune cut remains. The large prune cuts should be
painted with appropriate wound dressing/protective paint. Refer to the Advisory Circular PU 2.

2.4 Burying of Pruning

Burying of pruning besides its advantages of waste recycling and organic matter supply to tea
lands, will destroy residual populations of SHB in infested branches and thereby minimize the
chances of re-infestation.

2.5 Maintain Bush Vigor to Encourage Growth Compensation

Good Agricultural Practices on crop and land management recommended by the Tea Research
Institute should be adopted.

2.6 Chemical Control

2.6.1 New Clearings: All new clearings located in areas prone to SHB infestation (mid-elevation)
should be annually treated with the recommended insecticides as a prophylactic measure in order
to facilitate good frame development. Refer to the Advisory Circular PU 4 for recommended
chemicals, dosages, method of application and pre-harvesting intervals.

Spraying is recommended in May/June in the north-east sector and in December /January in the
south west sector. A repeat application is necessary after 6 to 8 weeks in the field where the SHB
attack already been noticed.

2.6.2. Mature Tea: Only application of Lime-Sulphur is recommended to protect mature tea fields
from SHB attacks. Refer to the Advisory Circular PU 4.

MANAGEMENT OF LOW COUNTRY LIVE WOOD TERMITE

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PM 3 Serial No. 6/03 issued in June 2003 and
previous related Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 2)

1. Introduction

Live-wood termites of tea emerged as economically important key pests in the Low- country in the
1960s following a rapid increase in areas under vegetatively propagated tea, it was coincidental
that the highest yielders of those clones that were used to replant old seedling tea areas also
turned out to be the most susceptible host plants for the two most prevalent species of live-wood
termites in the low-country.

On account of their high yield potential, cultivars TRI 2023 and TRI 2026 became very popular and
were therefore the most widely planted. They were also the cultivars most susceptible to this
group of pests, and as a result, the impact of termite damage on tea in the low country was
immediately felt. The significance of live-wood termites as a group of primary, and very injurious,
pests became apparent within a matter of a few years of large-scale planting of these two
cultivars.

2. Live-wood Termite Species Attacking Low Grown Tea

The most prevalent species of live-wood termites attacking tea in the low country are
Glyptotermes dilatatus and Neotermes greeni. The former is commonly referred to as the “Low-
country Live-wood Termite"" (LCLWT) and is the most widely distributed of the two species. It
attacks tea from sea level to an elevation of about 1,000 m a.m.sl. N greeni is usually encountered
in the upper elevations of the low country and also occasionally in the mid-country.

3. Behavioural Pattern

Biology, habits, preference for host plants, and dispersal are fairly similar for the species of low-
country live-wood termites, and are described below:

3.1. Dispersal: Alates (winged reproductives) are the one who responsible for dispersal and
founding the new colony. The alates of the two sexes emerged from the parent colony during the
onset of monsoons in rainy seasons attend to dispersal flight and alight on suitable host plants.
They pair off, shed their wings, and make their way into the bush through a ""soft spot"" on the stem.
These ""soft spots"" originate as wounds on pruning cuts, mechanical damages, SHB and canker
damages which have been acted upon by wood-rotting organisms to form dead wood. They
facilitate easy and fast entry of the termite pair, and the greatest incidence of termite damage is
seen to occur in fields that have been pruned 3-4 times without the adoption of sanitary measures.

3.2 Colony Formation: Once inside the stem, the parent pair gradually excavates a short gallery
and the female deposits the eggs, and the brood that develops from these eggs forms the initial
colony. The first set of larvae, nursed by the parent pair, develop into nymphs which then take
over the function of gallery-making and caring for all other inmates of the colony.
The Nymphs which function as workers are an immature stage that can either develop further into
mature casts like soldiers and reproductive stages or remain as they are with arrested
development, according to the requirement of the colony. Therefore, they are referred to as false
workers or pseudogates.

The nymphs developing into reproductive adults get transformed into two types. In one, the adult
is devoid of wings but reproductively it is active and more sclerotized than others. They perform
the function of egg laying and building up of the colony. These non-winged reproductives are
referred to as “supplementary reproductives” as they, in effect supplement the function of the
parent pair. The other type, which is also reproductively mature, develops wings but does not mate
or lay any eggs in the parent colony. These are referred to as “primary reproductives” or alates
and are responsible for the dispersal and founding of new colonies elsewhere. Their dispersal is
associated with increased atmospheric humidity, especially during the. pre-monsoon period, but
swarming populations have, however, been encountered in the air throughout the year. This
results in the susceptible host being prone to infestation at any time of the year.

3.3 Type of Damage: Until the main trunk is fully colonized and the second generation alates start
to emerge in dispersal, the host plant does not exhibit any external symptoms. It is only when the
galleries traverse across the conducting tissues of the vascular ring that free movement of water
and nutrients are interfered with, within the plant. At this stage symptoms of wilting or scorching of
individual branches are seen, particularly during periods of water stress.

Newly planted VP tea, even though it is a susceptible cultivar, is not generally infested until after
the first proper prune. This is because prune cuts which later develop ""soft spots"" for the termite
alates to enter through, are created only at the time of the first prune. However, termite alates can
enter through the stem and branch cankers in the new clearings. Termite-susceptible cultivars are
generally known to be prone to excessive die-back following pruning. Once inside the bush, the
individuals are perfectly protected from external mortality factors as they seal off the gallery
openings with their faecal matter. With time, the infestation progresses deep into the core of the
bush whereby the bush becomes debilitated, and this results in direct yield loss from the field.

4. Integrated Management of LCLWT

Management of LCLWT requires a multi-pronged approach with the focus being centered on host-
plant resistance. The important features of the integrated approach to manage LCLWT are given
below:

4.1. Planting of Tolerant Cultivars

High-yielding cultivars with tolerance to this termite should be planted wherever possible. A use of
mix of cultivars is also desirable. Planting the best suited cultivar for the region with Good
Agricultural Practices (GAPs) is essential for sustaining the productivity of the plantation. Please
refer to Advisory Circular PN 1 to select tolerant cultivars for LCLWT.

Special attention should be given to the cultivars TRI 2023, TRI 2026, TRI 2043 and TRI 4042
avoiding ""soft spots"" originate as wounds on pruning cuts, mechanical damages, SHB and canker
damages in termite-active areas.
4.2. Adoption of Sanitary Measures at Pruning

The implementation of sanitary pruning plays a major role in an integrated system of management.
All galleried stems should be removed by pruning them progressively down until no residual
colony is seen within the stems. Such action should be taken from the second prune onwards
since it is difficult to destroy the termite colony once established in the main stem of the tea bush.

4.3. Protection of Pruned Cuts from Wood rot fungi

Protection of the pruned cuts with an anti-microbial wound dressing is recommended to avoid
wood rot formation (please refer to Advisory Circular PU 2 for dosage and application method).

4.4.Protection from Stem, Branch and Collar Cankers
Refer to Advisory Circular DM 5 for the canker management.
4.5. Special Considerations with Machine Pruning and Mechanized Field Activities

As mechanized field operations for pruning and other agricultural practices tend to make damages
and wounds in tea, special care should be taken during the operation and immediate treatment of
wound dressings.

4.6.Planting of Diversionary Hosts

The common low-shade tree Gliricidia sepium serves as a diversionary host to the low country
live-wood termite. At the usual planting density of G. sepium (final spacing of 6 m x 7.2 m), it may
not have the necessary level of cushioning effect on tea, particularly when the tea cultivar is
susceptible. However, planting G. sepium as much as possible in the tea as well as in the
surrounding non-tea areas would help to reduce the number of colony founders attacking the tea.
Rotted snags in trees should be available during the swarming period to attract alates and those
should be removed and destroyed after swarming period.

4.7. Strengthening of Natural Predation by Establishing Perching Points in the Vicinity of
Tea for Birds and Bats

Natural predation on alates would contribute towards the natural control of this pest to a large
extent. It is necessary that these predators (birds and bats) are provided with suitable conditions
such as perching points in the vicinity of tea.

ADVISORY CIRCULAR _No.PMEE

Issued in: February 2024 Serial No. 14/24

PROTECTION OF YOUNG TEA FROM NEMATODES

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PM 4 Serial No. 02/10 issued in December 2010
and related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 4)

1. Introduction

Tea Nematodes are microscopic organisms, which inhabit the tea root system and the soil around.
Besides parasitizing and weakening the host root system, they interfere with the smooth uptake of
water and nutrients, leading to severe nutrient imbalance and physiological stress in the plant.

The economically important nematode pests of tea are

a. Pratylenchus loosi Loof - ""root-lesion nematode"" or ""meadow eelworm""
b. Radopholus similis (Cobb) Thorne - ""burrowing nematode”
c. Meloidogyne brevicauda Loof - ""root-knot nematode”

2. Symptoms of Damage

The typical symptoms of nematodes are slow decline in growth with the leaves turning a pale-
yellow colour, premature flowering and fruiting and stunted growth of the plant. Similar symptoms
could also be observed due to other stress factors such as drought, water deficit, water logging
and ill-drained conditions and nutrient imbalances etc.

3. Integrated Management of Nematodes in Young Tea

Plant parasitic nematodes affecting tea could be disseminated through planting materials, soil,
water and agricultural implement etc. In the presence of a susceptible root system of a good host,
the residual nematode populations may get developed. Hence, nematodes once introduced to
fields, they cannot be eradicated.

Further, all tea growing areas are declared as nematode active and / or prone areas due to
evidences on presence of either of above three species. Therefore, every attempt should be taken
for integrated management of nematodes by adhering to the following measures in young tea.

a. The area should be planted to rehabilitation grasses; Mana or Guatemala for a minimum
period of 2 years. Mana is recommended to all tea growing areas. In areas where the tea
has been found to be infested with the burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis,
Guatemala grass is not recommended as it is a good host. The CO3 (Hybrid Napier grass-
Pennisetum purpureum X P. americarnum) grass is recommended for lands with no
nematode history and for a minimum of 12 months of rehabilitation as the biomass
production is comparatively high (Please refer to Advisory Circular PM 12).

b. Use of nematode free and healthy planting materials of recommended cultivars to the
region for field planting (please refer to Advisory Circulars PN 1 on Suitability of Tea
Clones for the Different Regions and PN 2 on Good Nursery Management Practices).

c. Adopt all Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) recommended by TRI to ascertain a healthy
and vigorous plant growth.

d. Prophylactic chemical treatments to bring down any residual plant parasitic nematode
populations ensuring to avoid invasion to tea roots of the newly introduced tea plants as
described under section 4.

 

 
4. Prophylactic Measures at Planting

Nematode control through chemical treatments is not economical due to the hidden nature of
nematode damage in tea fields. Therefore, chemical application is restricted to the time of planting
in the Integrated Management of Nematodes. As a protective measure to minimize any residual
populations of parasitic nematodes, it is mandatory to incorporate a nematicide into soil in the
planting hole at planting.

The recommended nematicides at correct dosages should be used as described in the Advisory
Circular PU 4.

Alternatively, 100 g of ground or powdered neem oil cake (neem poonac) could be mixed with soils
in the planting hole.

5. Nematode Management in Infested Young Tea

When premature flowering and fruiting and / or any symptoms of debilitation have been observed,
the affected areas must be checked for the presence of nematodes. Proper sampling should be
done as per the method described in Advisory Circular PM 5 for nematode estimation at TRI. If the
cause for such symptoms has been confirmed as nematodes, the following measures should be
carried out over a period of 1 - 2 years.

a. An ‘Infestation-specific nematode management recommendation’ by TRI considering the
field and crop conditions.

b. When nematode affected patches or blocks with heavy infestations have been identified, in
situ block infilling; uproot affected tea in patches; remove all possible roots and rehabilitate
the area with a suitable grass species.

c. Under a very light nematode infestation with a nematode tolerant tea cultivar, planting of
nematode suppressive plant species such as Mana (Cymbopogon confertiflorus), Wild Sun
Flower (Tithonia diversiflora), Wild Chrysanthemum / Mari Kolondu (Artemisa vulgaris)
and Marigold (Tagetes sp.) against Pratylenchus loosi and Radopholus similis and Vetiver
(Vetivaria zizanoides) against Pratylenchus loosi.

d. Incorporation of soil organic amendments such as compost and well-decomposed
reclaimable tea (at the rate of 2 kg per plant) or neem oil cake (at the rate of 500g per plant
in two splits) depending on availability.

e. All Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) recommended by TRI to minimize impacts from
other possible factors leading to stress conditions i.e. soil pH, ill - drained and dry soil
conditions, graveliness, poor and imbalanced manuring etc.

SAMPLING FOR NEMATODE ANALYSIS

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PM 5 Serial No. 03/10 issued in December 2010
and related previous Advisory Circulars)

1. Introduction

All species of pathogenic nematodes of tea inhabit roots and soil. However, their number and
activity will depend on soil factors such as soil temperature, moisture, depth, use of agro-
chemicals and organic matter etc. and plant factors such as age, cultivar and pruning cycle.

Tea fields or nurseries may show symptoms caused by nematodes such as slow decline in growth,
yellowing of leaves, premature flowering and fruiting and stunted growth etc. due to other stress
factors such as drought, water deficit, clayeyness, hard pan and water logging conditions, nutrient
imbalances etc. Before taking samples for nematode estimation, such factors should be ruled out.

In order to assure a realistic nematode estimation, the sampling procedure should be different in a
nursery and a field. Necessary sampling should be done to represent different cultivars, ages,
conditions and symptoms of nematodes and weaknesses in plants of nursery or field.

Nematode diagnosis is also proposed as an internal quarantine measure in assuring use of
nematode free and healthy planting materials restricting dissemination of parasitic nematode
species through planting materials in the tea growing areas.

2. Sampling for Diagnostic Purposes

Early detection helps to check on the spread of nematode infestation. It could also curtail the
extent of damage by enabling the adoption of appropriate and timely corrective measures.
Sampling should therefore, be done at critical points where nematode introduction, establishment
and or development could possibly occur. Such vigilance is most essential amongst nursery, newly
planted young tea fields and mature tea. Infestation can only be confirmed by microscopic
examination of soil and root samples.

Soil and root sampling in the nursery/field should be assigned to a responsible person and be
carried out under close supervision. An analytical report would only be as good as the sample
submitted.

3. Sampling in the Nursery

Sampling should commence about six months after the putting out of cuttings, or seed, in the
nursery, when adequate roots have been developed. It is appropriate to sample the nursery prior
to restacking plants. A minimum of 10 g of root material is needed per sample and the method
adopted for sampling is as follows.

a. Take at least 5 plants at random from each bed of 1,000 plants.

b. Cut off the feeder roots, after removing the plants from the bags, and transfer the feeder
roots to a clean polythene bag.

c. Cover the root sample with some moist soil to avoid drying.

 
d. Label each bag with Estate name, Division, Cultivar, Bed No., Age, Date of sampling and
time.

In order to facilitate interpretation of the results of analysis and to give appropriate
recommendations, it is necessary to send the duly filled Nursery History Fact Sheet issued from
TRI.

4. Requisites of Field Sampling

Soil or root samples in the field should be drawn when the soil is adequately moist for at least 2
weeks.

Soil and root sampling should be avoided after any soil disturbances such as fertilizer, soil
agrochemical applications and / or organic matter additions. A minimum of one-month period
should be given for sampling.

It is also necessary to submit the duly perfected Crop and Field History Fact Sheet issued from
TRI along with the samples to receive a proper diagnostic report.

4.1. Sampling in New Clearings and Mature Fields

Sampling of tea fields suspected with nematode infestation is important for diagnostic purpose and
necessary recommendations. Both soil and roots are required for detecting the presence of
nematodes in tea fields. The following method should be adopted to draw representative soil
samples.

Additional samples may also be taken separately from fields and or patches and weak areas
showing possible nematode symptoms. In fields due for pruning, sampling is recommended to be
drawn 6 months prior to intended month of prune.

Divide the field into blocks of 2 ha each using natural boundaries such as footpaths etc. wherever
possible (Figure 1).

a. Collect 25-30 samples at random points from each such 2 ha block.

b. Collect about 50 g soil from each sampling point. The samples should be taken 15 cm (6"")
away from the base of the bush and at a depth of 15-25 cm (6-10"") with an Auger or
ordinary crow bar (‘Alavangoe"").

c. Also collect feeder roots from each sampling point.

d. Pool the soil and root samples obtained from respective blocks and make about 500 g of
the composite soil sample along with roots in a clean polythene bag and seal the bag
properly.

e. Label each bag using a permanent marker with Estate name, Division, Field No., Cultivar,
Block No., Age, Date of sampling and time. Also, a tag with above details may be inserted.

4.2. Sampling in Mature Fields Prior to Uprooting

Soil and root populations of the parasitic nematode species in tea fields are expected to be
aggravated with time. Hence, the residual nematode populations in mature tea fields due for
uprooting would possibly serve as a source of inoculum in new clearings.

Hence, sampling is recommended to be drawn 6 months prior to intended month of uprooting to
diagnose the nematode infestation level for adopting appropriate nematode management
practices.

In fields due for pruning, sampling is recommended to be drawn 6 months prior to intended month
of prune.

In fields identified for uprooting, sampling is recommended to be drawn 6 months prior to intended
month of uprooting to diagnose the nematode infestation level for adopting appropriate nematode
management practices.

5. Dispatch of Samples to TRI

The samples should be kept away from direct sunlight or any other condition that may promote
heat during sampling and transport to avoid overheating in order to ascertain the life of the
resident nematode populations.

The samples should be dispatched to the nearest Nematology Laboratories at Talawakelle,
Hantane, and Ratnapura. Samples need to reach the laboratories compulsorily within 48 hours of
sampling along with duly perfected Crop and Field / Nursery History Data sheet. Undue delay
could lead to dehydration and death of nematodes, thereby resulting in erroneous estimates of
nematode counts.

 
For a pre-arranged appointment to dispatch of samples to the TRI, please contact the respective
Nematology laboratories.

6. Important
Please note that the Institute does not accept the following samples for nematode estimation.

a. Water Samples: Testing of water for estimating nematodes is a laborious exercise which
requires advanced techniques for physical recovery of nematodes from a large volume of
water.

If an estate is in a nematode prone area and known to have nematode infested fields, one
should assume that the water courses running through the fields are contaminated. For further
details on preventing contamination, please refer to the Advisory Circular PM 8.

b. Soil for Filling Nursery Bags: It is mandatory that all soils intended to use for tea nursery
work be sterilized. For selection of soils for nurseries and soil sterilizing techniques, please
refer to the Advisory Circular PN 2.

MITE CONTROL

(This Advisory Circular supersedes Advisory Circular PM 6 with Serial No. 01/08 issued in June 2008 and
related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 4)

1. Introduction

Five species of mites cause damage to tea in Sri Lanka. Their common names are Red Spider
Mite (Oligonychus coffeae Neither), Scarlet Mite (Brevipalpus californicus Banks), Yellow Mite
(Hemitarsonemus latus Banks), Purple Mite (Calacarus carinatus Green) and Pink Rust Mite
(Acaphylla theae Watt).

Tea mites are generally dry-weather pests, feeding on tea foliage but also attacking other
vegetation, such as certain species of shade trees, cover crops, weeds, etc. Tea by roadsides and
in pockets, exposed to various environmental and physiological stress factors, are prone to
infestation by different species of mites.

Mites often make their appearance in isolated pockets at the beginning of dry weather, and unless
controlled in time they can spread over an entire field causing significant toss of the crop. In
particular, Scarlet Mite and Red Spider Mite could result in a setback to bush growth.

2. Mite-prone Fields and Spot Treatments

While some fields are prone to mite infestations, others are seldom affected. It is advisable to use
spot applications of acaricides for prevention rather than as a curative measure after infestation.

3.Rain and Mites

Though mite infestation is generally less pronounced during wet weather, mild wet-weather
conditions are not conducive to its eradication. In fact, light rain promotes Yellow Mite. Red Spider
Mite infestations continue into monsoonal weather once the populations reach high levels.

4.Damage Symptoms
4.1. Red Spider Mite

It mainly attacks the upper surface of the maintenance foliage. This mite could be identified by the
bronze colouration of its upper surface. Webs and minute white specks of cast skin are visible.

Thumb Nail Test. When a thumb is pressed against an affected leaf, a pin-dot mark of mite blood
appears.

4.2. Purple Mite

Older leaves are preferred. These mites occur on both surfaces of the leaf. The leaves attacked
have a dull matt appearance and a purplish-bronze discolouration.

4.3. Pink Rust Mite

Young leaves are preferred. Mostly found on the under surface of the leaf, but found on the upper
surface as well. Petioles and tender stems are also attacked. The affected leaves become pale in
colour and curl upwards. The veins and margins show a pinkish discolouration.

4

 
4.4. Scarlet Mite

Feeds mainly on the lower surface of the maintenance foliage, especially near the midrib and on
the petiole. There is a dark-brown necrosis of the midrib and petiole. Heavy attack leads to severe
defoliation.

4.5. Yellow Mite

Mainly attacks the younger leaves, the first 2 or 3 leaves and the bud. Found in nurseries, young
tea fields and fields recovering from prune The flush is stunted, deformed and brittle, and pale and
yellow in colour The feeding area remains as a light corky-brown necrotic strip over the mid-rib.

5. Integrated Approaches to Manage Mites

In order to ensure successful control of mites in tea lands, proper monitoring should be undertaken
for obtaining an understanding of the spread, locations and specific times of the year where the
mites occur.

5.1. Planting of non-host plants of mites on road sides such as Artemisia spp., Wild sunflower as
the road side with dust enhances the buildup of mite population.

5.2. Improve and maintain shade during dry period to reduce stress for tea as the stressed plants
are highly susceptible to mites.

5.3. Ensure balanced fertilization to minimize stress.
5.4. Chemical Control

Chemical spraying should be used only when the signs of mite damages appear and the
infestation stages of the mites are known.

Please refer Advisory Circular PU 4 for recommended acaricides and dosages.
For effective control of mites, spraying should be done to the undersurface of the foliage as well.
Spraying in plucking fields should be carried out immediately after plucking.

When fields sprayed with Sulphur, the green leaves should be bulked with ten times the amount of
flush from unsprayed areas.

CONTROL OF WHITE GRUBS

(This Advisory Circular Supersedes Advisory Circular PM 7 Serial No. 04/02 issued in November 2002 and
related previous Advisory Circulars and links to PU 4)

1. Introduction

The root-feeding larvae of scarabaeid beetles (chafers or cockchafers) are commonly known as
“white grubs” and about 90% of the reported damage in tea is in new clearings. Damage is also
seen in tea nurseries, new clearings, infilling blocks, mana or Guatemala clearings and
occasionally in fuel wood clearings. The damage in new clearings is significant in the following
areas: Udapussellawa, Dimbula, Maturata, Pundaluoya, Pussellawa, Kotmale, Madulsima,
Dickoya, Welimada, Nuwara Eliya, Haputale, Dolosbage, Hewaheta, Passara, Ratnapura and
Galle. It is recommended that the plantations in Udapussellawa, Dimbula and Maturata districts
should protect their new clearings from white grub damage as a routine practice through
prophylactic treatments. Also, proper vigilance should be maintained to detect early infestation of
white grubs.

2. Cyclic Pattern of White Grub Development

The adult beetles deposit their eggs in the soil from about March to June. Large numbers of these
beetles are often attracted to lights in March/April. The ovipositing beetles can be encountered
underneath thatch covers or in the surface soil. The larvae start emerging from eggs from about
June until about August. The feeding grubs, which assume a “C” shape when exposed, are found
in the soil from June to November. Pupation commences generally in October, reaching a peak in
January of the following year. The chronological pattern of the life cycle of cockchafers is the same
in both south-west and north-east monsoon zones.

3. Damage Symptoms

Of the different species of white grubs found in tea lands Holotrichia disparilis and Microtrichia
costata cause economically significant injury to young plants in new clearings. The grubs can move
from plant to plant. H. disparilis often chews the roots off completely, leaving a callused stump from
which the plant may attempt to regenerate new roots. The grubs can also, ring-bark the young
plants at the collar. M. costata may also, attack shade trees such as Acacia decurrence.

Anomala superflua is a low country species attacking mainly timber species like Teak and also,
nursery plants and occasionally tea roots. Leucopholis pinguis attacks grasses, at times completely
devouring the roots like in Mana and not allowing the grasses to recover. Damage to Guatemala
does not generally kill the grass as adventitious develop from nodes above the damaged section.

4. Attraction to Organic Matter

All attacks have been encountered in soils rich in decaying organic matter. The grubs are found
predominantly in areas of the fields having high organic matter content and hardly any in sandy
and gravelly areas. When compost is used in planting holes and or as soil amendments, white grub
adults could be attracted.

) T.R.I. ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.PME@

 
 

5. Integrated Approach to Manage White Grubs
5.1 Land Preparation

Forking and cultivation of soil during land preparation will facilitate the exposure of white grubs to
predators such as birds.

5.2 Light Traps

Light traps placed during March-May in white grub-prone areas will trap adult beetles in dispersal
flight.

5.3 Special Care with Agronomic Operations
To avoid white grub adult attraction, special attention and care should be taken for when

i. compost is used in planting holes and or as soil amendments.
ii, live mulches such as Mana, grasses etc are used.
iii. organic matter is broadcast in tea lands i.e. compost, reclaimable tea and paddy husk etc.

5.4 Artificial Mulching

Artificial agriculture mulch restricts egg laying by adult beetles around tea bushes. Thatching
should be done prior to the egg laying period which usually begins from March to May.

5.5 Chemical Control

The grubs have an extended feeding period of about 8 months. Tea plants can succumb to grub
damage during the 1-3 years. The new clearings should be protected from the grubs during June-
October. Repeat application may be necessary in 2"" year if the grubs are active in the field during
June- October.

Please refer to Advisory Circular PU 4 to select recommended chemicals and dosages.

MEASURES TO AVOID CONTAMINATION OF NURSERY PLANTS WITH
NEMATODES THROUGH IRRIGATION WATER

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PM 8, Serial No. 07/03 issued in July 2003 and
related previous Advisory Circulars)

1. Introduction

Tea nurseries at all altitudes are potentially be infested by different species of nematodes.
Therefore, all good nursery practices should be strictly adapted as described in Advisory Circular
PN 2 in order to produce healthy, vigorous and nematode free planting materials.

There is a possibility to use water running through tea lands in nurseries. When such water is used
for irrigation purposes, the nursery plants may get contaminated besides the nursery hygiene is
maintained. Hence, all preventive measures should be implemented in different regions depending
on existing facilities.

2. Source of Contamination of Irrigation Water

Water courses running through infested fields wash away soil contaminated with parasitic
nematodes and their eggs. When water from such sources is collected, there is a high probability
of this water becoming contaminated. When contaminated water is used to irrigate tea nurseries,
over a period of time, it could transmit adequate numbers of nematodes to the roots of young
nursery plants. Such contaminated plants not only suffer themselves, but also, disseminate the
infestation into the new clearings, when they are planted out.

Continued watering may supply a very few nematodes in suspension, i.e., 2 to 3 per 5 1 which is
sufficient to bring about significant infestation levels for young nursery plants.

3. Methods for Prevention of Contamination of Irrigation Water
The following options are important in preventing water being contaminated with nematodes.
3.1 Sedimentation of Run-off Ravine Water

Nematodes besides their light weight get settled in water with time due to gravity. When
nematodes are immersed in water for a long period, they get asphyxiated and killed. The dead as
well as the moribund nematodes sediment at the bottom of the water should be periodically
drained out.

3.1.1 Construction of a Sedimentation System

A series of water tanks inclusive of two sedimentation tanks (A & B) and storage tank/s (C) to suit
to the capacity in accordance with the daily irrigation requirements should be constructed in a way
that one feeds the other following a sedimentation period (Figure). The storage tank/s (C) should
be of adequate capacity to collect sufficient quantity of water that is needed to irrigate the entire
nursery any day.

Plastic water tanks available in the market, and cement tanks are suitable for the purpose. Outlet
of the plastic tanks should be modified to suit the requirement shown in the Figure 1.
Two tanks of.similar capacity should be built with the outlet pipe of the first tank fitted about one
foot from the base and leading into the second tank. The inlet of the second tank should be a few
centimeters from the top the two tanks should be built at split level (Figure 1). The tanks can be
located at different heights on a sloppy land. Allow the water in the first tank to sediment for 24
hours and open the water into the second tank the following day. The water in the second tank
should also be allowed to sediment for another 24 hours and released into the storage tank/s.

The bottom 30 cm layer of the water in any tank should not be used for irrigation. Instead it should
be drained out to a pit or drain which carries the sediment out of the nursery. The outlet pipe that
feeds the next tank should be fitted in such a manner that this bottom layer of water is not tapped.
It is also important that the sedimentation tank unit be regularly checked and monitored for proper
functioning.

3.2 Harness of a Well or a Spout

In the absence of a natural spring in the vicinity of the nursery to supply water for irrigating
nursery, a special well dug out with raised wall to a height of 2 feet above the soil level, to prevent
contamination during rainy weather.

3.3 Mini Tank construction

The potential sources of such contamination are mainly from run-off water and ravine water.
Therefore, these should be diverted away from tea lands through well built drains. A stream may
be blocked using a mini dam in such a way that water shall be retained as a reservoir. Such water
shall be used for irrigation purpose after setting down for minimum of two days.
3.4 Water Treatment using Bleaching Powder

Water stored in a tank, reservoir shall be directly treated with Bleaching powder to disinfect all
organisms including germs, bacteria and fungi and parasitic nematodes.

For water treatment purpose, commercial bleaching powder at the rate of 1 kg per 1000 | water
basis should be used.

Bleaching powder should be thoroughly mixed using a stick and the treated water should be left
for minimum of 12 hours prior to use for irrigation. Water treatment with bleaching powder shall be
done in the evening for purpose of irrigation on the following day.

4. Important

If the tea nursery is located in an estate with known nematode history, one should assume that the
water courses running though fields could possibly be contaminated. This necessitates
compulsory preventive measures described as above.

T.R.I. ADVISORY CIRCULAR

 

 
 

Issued in: February 2024 Serial No. 19/24

MANAGEMENT OF UP COUNTRY LIVE WOOD TERMITE

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PM 9 Serial No. 02/08 issued in June 2008 and related
previous Advisory Circulars)

1. Method of Detection of Termite-infested Tea

The Up Country Live-wood Termite (Postelectrotermes militaris Desneux) is reported in areas of
Maskeliya and high elevations of Pundaluoya and Radella. It gains entry into the tea plant through the
roots and constructs galleries within the woody tissues of the roots, collar, and finally the
branches. As a result of this concealed habitat, an infested bush remains unnoticed. However,
when branches are affected, prune cuts made at the time of pruning would show cavities filled with
faecal matter, and occasionally the termites as well.

During periods of moisture stress, one or two branches on a bush may also show signs of wilting. Since
such wilting may be caused by reasons other than termite infestation, a few of these branches should be
cut back and examined to confirm whether termite infestation is the cause, or whether there are other
causes.

2. Method of Uprooting Termite-infested Areas

When termite-infested bushes are noticed at pruning, the frames of neighbouring bushes should also be
examined carefully for signs of galleries. Such infested bushes should be uprooted until two concentric
rings of plants show no further signs of infestation by termites. The particular patch should be
blocked out, the area deep-forked and all tea roots, at least up to pencil thickness, should be removed.
The uprooted plants and roots should be collected and burnt in situ, and should not be transported out
of the infested area. A few old tar- or oil barrels could be used to burn the infested bushes and roots.

3. Treatments

Even though all infested plants and roots are removed and burnt in situ, in practice a few roots are likely
to be left behind, from which re-infestation could subsequently occur. An extended period of
rehabilitation (up to four years) would guarantee the decay of such root fragments, and so prevent re-
infestation. It is therefore suggested that after having ensured a thorough root-removal operation
following uprooting, commencing around December of the year of prune, the area be leveled and
prepared for planting with Guatemala or Mana grass with the onset of the south-west monsoonal rains
in May/June of the year following the prune. The grass should then be retained throughout the entire
cycle (4-5 years) and the block planted to tea in the year of the following prune. During the extended
period of rehabilitation under grass, any small, infested root fragments left behind would have decayed.
The grass should be regularly lopped, and the loppings incorporated into the soil to improve the soil
organic matter content and the soil structure.

4. Integrated Management of UCLWT

4.1. Suggested Programme for Termite Control

Termite control on the estate scale should not be attempted haphazardly and a well-defined
programme should be developed to control the pest (Figure 1). Work should be undertaken on a
priority basis, and programmed in the following manner.

Sea g |

 
Termite-infested patches in fields that are to be retained for a long period (Group 2) and those to
be uprooted and replanted at the end of the cycle (Group 1) should be very clearly demarcated.

Priority 1

Termite-infested patches in Group 2 fields should be uprooted in December of the year of prune as
recommended above and planted with Guatemala or Mana grass in May/June of the year following the
prune. These patches should be block in-filled with tea at the next prune only after a period of three
years’ rehabilitation (if it is on a four-year cycle) or four years’ rehabilitation (if it is on a five-year cycle).
As planting of Guatemala or Mana has to be completed by May/June of the year following the prune, the
number of termite patches that could be tackled would depend on the availability of labour. However, if
all termite patches in such fields cannot be properly treated prior to the planting of Guatemala or Mana
by May/June in the year following the prune, they should be left under tea and tackled on the same
basis in the following pruning cycle.

Priority Il

Termite-infested patches in Group 1 fields should be uprooted as recommended above, in December of
the 2™ year from prune, and these patches planted with Guatemala or Mana in May/June of the 3
year from prune. However, if there are a large number of termite patches in fields due for uprooting
and replanting, it may not be possible to have all of them treated and ready for planting with Guatemala
or Mana by May/June of the 3” year. In such instances, some of the patches may be uprooted in
December of the 3° year, and planted with Guatemala or Mana by May/June of the 4"" year at the
latest. This will effectively eliminate the loss of identity of the termite patches when the entire field is
uprooted. Following the treatment of termite patches, the general uprooting should commence in
December of the 5"" year, and the soil rehabilitated for a period of two years with Guatemala or Mana
as shown in the Schedule (Figure 1). When the method of treatment undergrass, suggested above, is
adopted, followed by the usual two-year rehabilitation under Guatemala grass following the general
uprooting of the field, the termite-infested patches would have beenunder grass for about 5-6
years.

It is assumed that in all the A-category fields, and the better B-category fields, one would come
across only a few termite-infested patches. If for some reason or the other, one encounters large
numbers of termite-infested patches distributed throughout a given field, such a field should obviously be
considered as one that needs to be replanted, and not as one needing an attempt at in-filling.

incorporated in termite infested tea lands at the rate of (i) reclaimable tea 400 g + neem oil cake
200 g or (ii) Alocasia (Habarala) 2.6 kg per plant depending on the availability.

FUMIGATION OF NURSERY SOILS FOR NEMATODE ERADICATION

(This Advisory Circular supersedes Advisory Circular PM 11 Serial No. 05/09 issued in November 2009 and
related previous Advisory Circulars)

1. Introduction

Parasitic nematodes, once introduced into fields, cannot be eradicated even by chemical means
and hence, adopting preventive measures are of paramount importance in the integrated
nematode management strategies. As such, in the integrated nematode management strategies,
methods of control are largely confined to treatment of nursery soils.

2. Nematode Control in Nurseries

Nurseries are the usual focal points of spread of nematode infestation. Nematode spread through
planting materials has been evident within an estate, from estate to estate, estates to small
holdings and even among tea growing areas in different agro ecological regions. Resultantly, poor
early establishment and growth, yield decline, and even death of mature plants can occur. This is
especially so with the usage of nematode tolerant tea cultivars that may possibly carry nematodes
without showing symptoms in the nursery plants. It is therefore, essential to take all precautionary
measures to prevent nursery plants from being contaminated with plant parasitic nematodes as
there is no curative method and the yield losses cannot be compensated by any other means.
Hence, disinfection of nursery soils and the premises is compulsory in all tea growing regions.
Amongst various methods, soil fumigation using chemicals is the most effective means of
nematode eradication in nursery soils.

All soils and nursery premises should be mandatorily fumigated and ensuring nursery hygiene to
eradicate all possible contaminations with nematode pests in view of guaranteeing nematode free
planting materials.

3. Prerequisites for Fumigation

In order to assure effective soil fumigation process and avoid failures, the following prerequisites
should strictly be followed with advance planning in addition to the Good Nursery Practices (GNPs)
specified in Advisory Circular PN 2.

3.1 Nursery Site

e Select a little elevated location above tea fields and a demarcated area with deep drains to
avoid subsequent cross contaminations through runoff water from surrounding nematode
infested tea lands.

e Avoid locations with a history of nematodes as far as possible to reduce risk of possible
contaminations.

e Reserve an adequate floor space in the nursery site to spread the soil volumes for fumigation
purpose, preferably a disinfected area.

e Select the premises away from resident areas and heavy human and animal movements to
avoid exposure to the chemicals.
3.2 Raised Beds

Always use raised beds to avoid re-contamination through water and worker movements to ensure
proper hygiene. Raised beds will improve the drainage of beds as well.

3.3 Soil

e Choose the suitable soils in adequate volumes for fumigation after sieving the soils.

e Avoid selecting dry soils. Moist the soil two weeks before fumigation to activate moribund
nematodes, fungi, bacteria efc., and to induce germination of weed seeds, which would
enhance fumigation efficiency. However, avoid wetting the soil 5 days prior to fumigation, as
the soil should not be excessively wet at the time of fumigation.

e Keep the soil preferably in a shed until use, to avoid drying and / or wetting

e Turn the soil heap into a rectangular shape box with a height not exceeding 20 cm (8 inches)
and any convenient width and length to accommodate the required soil volume (one cube of
soil is equal to 100 cubic feet)

3.4 Irrigation

Irrigation water could contaminate the nurseries with parasitic nematode species. Therefore,

please refer to Advisory Circular PM 8 for arranging irrigation water or well water system in

advance to ensure pathogenic nematodes free water.

3.5 Materials

Required quantities of fumigants recommended by the TRI (Please refer Advisory Circular PU 4),
undamaged transparent / translucent polythene sheets of gauge 500, mammoties or shovel and
watering can.

3.6 Safety

* Select masks, gloves and boots to suit the workers

* Make the first aid kit available in the premises

+ Arrange the record keeping factsheet (Table 2) and Re Entry Interval (REI) warning board

4. Soil Fumigants

Soil fumigants are substances or mixtures of substances which produce gas, vapour, fumes or
smoke expected to reach and kill all forms of biological organisms.

The objective of fumigation is best achieved when nematodes are fully active and the fumigant is
readily transformed into fumigating substances. Also, it is necessary that the contaminated soil is
exposed with free movement of fumigating substances and the treated soil is aerated to allow
untransformed fumigants to disperse after the process.

4.1 Mode of Action of Fumigation

The chemical on contact with soil moisture, is transformed into active compounds mainly methyl
isothiocyanate (MITC) which are light in weight and volatile in nature. The production of MITC
depends mainly on soil moisture and temperature.
The MITC fumes penetrate spaces between soil particles destroying the active soil organisms and
germinated seeds. As the effectiveness of fumigation process depends on concentration of the
active compounds transformed and the length of exposure to target organisms, the texture and
moisture of soil, physiological state of the organisms and degree of covering treated soil are the
determining factors. Nematodes in root fragments, nematodes in resting or dormant stages,
dormant seeds are unlikely to be destroyed while, all the free living and motile nematodes and
germinating seeds are affected. Chemical transformation in soils occurs within 1 - 5 hours
depending on the type of soil used. Odour of hydrogen sulfide and the strong eye-irritating
properties of MITC can be experienced soon after application of fumigant. Immediate and complete
covering would therefore be critical and helpful to avoid rapid loss due to volatilization and to
enhance the performance of fumigation process. Exposure of soil for one week completely
eradicates the nematodes. Thereafter, the cover should be removed to escape residual MITC
fumes which would otherwise cause phytotoxic effects on cuttings. Mixing and turning the treated
soils several times at regular intervals would help to enhance this process.

5. Soil Fumigation Process

5.1 Method of Soil Fumigation

The soils prepared for fumigation should be treated according to the schedule given in Table 1 in
order to ensure effective fumigation process.

Table 1. Schedule of nursery fumigation

 

 

Step Operation Time
1 Prepare soil heap and keep soil moisten At least 2 weeks before soil

sodium bottle and the spread / sprinkle the required
amount of fumigant evenly.

4 Mix the chemical immediately into soil by turning the
soil uniformly using a mammoty

5 Level and turn the treated soil in to a rectangular
shape box to a height not exceeding 20 cm (8 inches)

6 Moisten soil lightly by a watering can

7 Cover the soil immediately with a 500 gauge

5.2 Record Keeping

All the steps followed as per the time schedule including the names of person/s fumigating
individual soil heap/s should be recorded for reference by managers, inspectors and / or extension
personnel. Sample of a record keeping factsheet is shown in Table 2. It is also advisable to
maintain such records on display boards along with individually treated soil heaps.

6. Nursery Bed sterilization

Previous nursery beds could possibly contain nematode infested soil as well as tea root fragments
with residual nematode populations which could bring infestation to the new plants. Hence, it is
essential to treat the nursery beds prior to stacking nursery bags in order to avoid possible
contamination with treated soil.

The following should be carried out at least two weeks prior to stacking of the nursery bags filled
with fumigated soil.

1) Bed fumigation using bleaching powder at the rate of 10 g per square meter basis. It is
important to remove all roots from the bed by forking.

2) Lay a thick gauge porous polythene over the bed.

Never use un-fumigated soils such as soils from drains and beds for stacking and restacking
purposes, and for other general nursery operations. Therefore, always maintain a reserve of
fumigated soil for such purposes.

In case there is a history of nematodes in the nursery and/ or surrounding area, please obtain
additional advice on precautions and treatments from Nematologist, TRI.

7. Safety

7.1 Occupational and Residential Exposure

For personal safety, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and protective clothing should strictly be
used by the workers during treatment.
Following treatment, human and animal entry should be prevented by imposing Restricted Entry
Interval (REI) of 8 days. A display board should be visibly posted at the fumigated site.
7.2 Environmental Safety

Adequate measures should be taken to dispose used bags, containers and bottles of the fumigants
to avoid dissipating chemical residues to air and water bodies.

Fumigants should always be stored under cool and humid conditions and away from direct sun
light and heat. Plan to use the whole bottle of Metham for appropriate volume of soil; once opened,
do not leave any balance in the bottle for reuse.

Note: As soil fumigation is mandatory for all the tea growing regions, nursery soils need not be
tested for nematodes.

UPROOTING, REHABILITATION AND REPLANTING
OF NEMATODE INFESTED TEA LANDS

(This Advisory Circular supersedes Advisory Circular No. N 4 issued in August 1990)

1. Introduction
1.1 Mitigation of Nematode Infestations

Microscopic nematode pests once introduced and established in a tea land, it is difficult to
eradicate. Direct damage and secondary effects by plant parasitic nematodes causes long-term
and unrecoverable effects leading to instability in crop yields. Associations of other secondary
disease complexes and physiological disorders along with inferior or poor crop and soil conditions
further aggravate to minimize establishment, productivity and profitability of tea. Chemical control
of nematodes is anyway not economic and practical in tea fields. Maintaining such areas would
therefore be uneconomical as well as serve as nematode inoculums for rest of sections and or
hitherto uninfested tea areas. Thus, all steps described below should be strictly adopted in all tea
growing areas in view of mitigating the nematode incidence in tea.

1.2 Importance of Replanting Nematode Infested Areas in Integrated Nematode
Management

Replanting is considered an important agronomic operation which replaces unproductive, old,
nematode and other soil pathogen infested tea lands or sections as well as fields with stress
factors limiting growth and productivity of tea. In this context, the aims of replanting are therefore
to correct the limiting factors in the land for a sustainable, productive and cost effective newly
established crop.

Proper soil sampling for nematode infestation should be carried out in unproductive immature or
mature tea fields and prior to uprooting as per instructions given in the Advisory Circular PM 5. If
nematode infestation has been ruled out as the main stress factor or leading to soil sickness in an
area, the following steps should be rigidly followed during the replanting process. In the whole
process of replanting, removal of plant and field limiting attributes, preparation of land, selection of
appropriate sources of planting materials to suit to new planting should be given due
consideration.

2. Rehabilitation of Nematode Infested Areas
2.1 Uprooting Procedure

All diseased and unproductive bushes should be uprooted manually or preferably with the aid of
mechanical winches, if available. A single tea plant should not anyway be left in the area which
may serve as a source of nematodes. The operation should be done from top to bottom in order to
avoid subsequent nematode contaminations.

If nematode infested tea bushes of a patch of land or section are to be removed, tea plants in the
concentric circle should also be uprooted in order to ensure complete removal of nematode
sources.
Following uprooting, the area should be forked thoroughly to a depth of about 45 cm (18 inches)
and all tea roots, above the thickness of a pencil to be removed.

Uprooted tea bushes should not be taken away and transported from place to place to avoid
dissemination of nematode infestation. The roots removed from the ground should be collected
and burnt in situ.

Soils should not anyway be collected for nursery purpose (Please refer the Advisory Circular PN 2
for sources of nursery soils).

2.2 Land Preparation

Any soil limiting stress factor such as hard pan, ill-drained, water logging or gravelly condition etc.
should be corrected to facilitate proper establishment of new plants. Also, along with leveling and
land preparation, complete all other field operations such as terracing and drains, shade tree
planting efc. in order to minimize chances of subsequent nematode contaminations.

2.3 Rehabilitation of Lands Using Grasses

Rehabilitation of nematode infested tea fields and or the area / block identified for infilling process
with a non host plant species is a pre requisite in all tea growing areas in view of imposing a long
break for not allowing the nematode to survive and multiply further.

Improvement of soil biological, chemical and physical characters conducive for the new crop is
also envisaged through acceleration of organic matter status, structure, neutralize allelopathic
effects of long-term cultivation of tea, break down residues of agro chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers
etc. Resultantly, development and multiplication of densities of inherent natural enemies of
nematodes such as bacteria, fungi, micro arthropods, free living and saprophytic nematode
species are favored.

The nematode infested area/s identified by the TRI be planted with Mana or Guatemala for an
extended rehabilitation period as recommended by the TRI.

Mana is recommended to all tea growing areas. In areas where the tea has been found to be
infested with the burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, Guatemala grass is not recommended
as it is a good host.

CO3 (Hybrid Napier grass - Pennisetum perpureum X P. americarnum) grass is recommended for

lands with no nematode history and for a minimum of 12 months of rehabilitation as the biomass
production is comparatively high (Please refer TRI Guideline 02/2018 issued in December 2018).

The grass rehabilitated areas should be maintained by regular lopping along with recommended
inputs; fertilizers etc. (Please refer to Advisory Circular SP 6 for application rates).

The grass should be cut periodically before flowering and incorporated in to the land to improve
the organic matter levels.

NOTES:

Patna areas and lands with Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) are not considered as grass
rehabilitated areas.

Soils from grass rehabilitated areas meant for replanting should never be taken for nursery
purpose instead, a separate grass lands should be maintained.

Further, cut grass from rehabilitated areas meant for replanting should not be taken away for
thatching purpose instead, a separate grass lands should be maintained.
3. Replanting

The rehabilitated land should be planted with uninfested, healthy and vigorous plants of nematode
tolerant cultivars recommended to the region (Please refer to the Advisory Circular PN 1).

As an additional insurance against possible contamination of the young plants, it is vital to
incorporate a nematicide in the planting as a prophylactic treatment (Please refer to the Advisory
Circular PU 4 for recommended chemicals and rates).

THE SUITABILITY OF TEA CLONES FOR THE DIFFERENT REGIONS
(This Circular cancels Circulars No. C 1 to C 13)

Continuous efforts by TRI to evolve clones have led to the release of several clones of
the TRI 2000, 3000 and 4000 series. Of these TRI clones, more than 90 per cent are
derived from a single plant designated as ASM 4/10. In addition to the above clones,
under the guidance of the TRI, tea estates have also selected several clones and these
are known as estate clones.

At present over 55 per cent of Sri Lanka’s tea extent is under clones. The majority of the
clones are TRI 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. This has led to a narrowing of the
genetic base thereby making them vulnerable to pests, diseases, drought and other
hazards.

Wherever possible, the following should be adopted in selecting planting material:
(i) Select at least 5 - 6 clones depending on their suitability for the particular
location and extent, provided that not more than 10 per cent of the estate

is under a single clone.

(ii) Clonal suitability can be tested by small-scale planting (at least 200
bushes).

The recommended clones given in Table 1 and their characteristics in Tables 2a and 2b
will help in the selection of clones for planting.

Note: Though not listed in this Circular, clones performing well in a particular
locality could be considered for planting in that locality.

Tea NurseRY MANAGEMENT

1. Introduction

Nursery management is an most important operation for successful tea cultivation in the field. The
success of tea plantation depends largely on the vigour and the quality of nursery plants used. The
primary objective of nursery management is to raise healthy, vigorous and uniform plants from suitable
cultivars with minimum casualties over an appropriate period of time at a minimum cost. A plant raised
in the nursery of about 30 cm height comprising approximately 15 leaves with 2 - 3 side shoots, anda
well developed root system is considered as suitable for planting. Good Nursery Practices (GNP) including
advance planning, correct and timely implementation of nursery operations are essential to produce
healthy and uniform plants in a nursery as described below.

2. Schedule of operations
Nursery activities for different tea growing regions are shown in Table 1.

Field planting Up country & Uva: in 10 - 12 months May - Jun Oct-Nov = Apr - Jun
Low country: in 8 - 9 months

3. Selection of site
~“Anursery site must be centrally located to facilitate easy and constant supervision. The size of the site

depends on the annual requirement of plants and the lie and slope of the land. Factors to be considered.
in the selection of a site are;
¢ Proximity to a source of water
* Good drainage
* Protection from wind
* Proximity to the source of soil
* Proximity to the source of planting material
* Absence of over hanging branches of trees

4. Preparation of beds
The ideal size of a bed should be about 1.0 m wide (3.5 ft) and could be of any convenient length of
about 20 m (65 ft), with a pathway of 60 cm (2 ft) on either side for carrying out nursery operations, Beds
are built in a north-south direction to receive sunlight throughout the day. The beds should be raised to

1
about 15 cm (6 inches) for helping drainage and to avoid contamination of bags with nematodes
subsequently through running water and, to avoid possible operational damages to the plants.

Selection of soil

The growth of nursery plants largely depends on the texture (the proportion of sand, silt and clay) of the
soil. Loamy soils containing sufficient fine particles (clay and silt) to hold up water together with sand to
facilitate excess water to drain out are suitable for nurseries. The pH of the soil should be within a range
of 4.5 and 5.5, preferably around 5 for successful rooting and growth. The soils chosen for bagging
should be sieved using a No. 4 mesh to remove stones, pebbles and large root particles. The sources
of soit suitable for nurseries are as follows.

5.1 Grass soil
Asoil where Guatemala or Mana grass has been grown for a period of year or two with a substantial
amount of un-decomposed roots that make the soil friable with good drainage and adequate aeration.

5.2 Patana soil
Soil collected from patna lands where grasses, ferns and shrubs have grown naturally.

5.3 Jungle soil
Soil with suitable texture from natural jungles, Eucalyptus or Pinus plantations/blocks can be used.
The surface organic matter (decaying leaves and.twigs) should be removed prior to use.

5.4 Sub soil
This is obtained from a depth beyond 30 cm from the soil surface. After sieving (with No. 4 mesh),
its texture should be improved by adding fine sand proportionately (one part of fine sand with four
to six parts of soil depending on clayiness of the soil).

. Soil treatment

Soil should not be collected for nursery when it is too wet or dry in order to preserve the desired
structure. Soil collected should be heaped in an enclosed area and protected from rain by thatching/
covering until it is used.

Soils collected from all tea growing areas should be fumigated before use to eradicate nematode pests
in soil. Please refer Advisory Circular No PM 11 for current recommendations of the fumigants, dosages
and application methods.

As an alternative to soil fumigation, soil solarization is also possible in areas where at least five hours
of sunshine per day is available for a minimum period of six consecutive weeks. As solarization is
subjective to local conditions it is necessary to obtain advice on soil solarization methods from the TRI
by submitting weather records such as the number of rainy days and daily sunshine hours for the last
three years.

. Alternate soil media

When soil is scarce, organic materials such as tea waste, paddy husk and coir dust may be used along
with soil. These alternate media will also help improve the quality and vigour of nursery plants. Other
comparative benefits include reduction of soil requirement, labour use and cost and easy transportation
due to the light weight of such materials.
7.1 Organic materials

Organic materials with the following requirements should be selected depending on their accessibility
and availability.

Organic material Specifications and requirements
Refuse tea Well decomposed under natural conditions
Paddy husk Fresh or partially decomposed; wastes obtained preferably from
Japanese huller and free of bran and grain pieces
Coir dust Fresh or decomposed; not from coastal areas
7.2 Methods of use

Different alternate media could be used either.in layer arrangement or as mixtures. The soil used
for layers and/or mixtures should be fumigated as specified in the Advisory Circular No. PM 11.
The organic material and soil should be lightly watered and mixed thoroughly prior to making the
mixture.

7.2.1 Layer arrangement
The top one-third (1/3) of the nursery bag should be filled with soil to facilitate early rooting
with minimum causalities. The bottom two-third (2/3) should be filled with a mixture of organic
material and soil in the ratios given below which will help establish roots and growth.

Organic material Ratio of organic material : soil Remarks

Refuse tea 1:1 100% refuse tea could also be used

Paddy husk 1:40r1:2 1: 2 for areas where prolonged dry
weather is expected

Coir dust 1:1 100% coir dust could also be used

7.2.2 Mixture arrangement

The whole nursery bag should be filled with 1 : 1 refuse tea: soil or 1 : 1 paddy husk: soil or
1: 1 coir dust: soil mixtures.

7.3 Special considerations
Special attention should be paid to give optimum water requirement when using the above growing
media. As paddy husk retains less water, frequent watering may be required whereas refuse tea
requires less water as it retains more water.

. Filling the polythene sleeves

Guage of the polythene should be 150. Standard size of a sleeve is 10 cm or 4 inches in diameter (12.7
cm or 5 inches layflat) and 23 cm or 9 inches long and, about 400 such sleeves can be made from 1 kg
of polythene sleeve of 150 gauge. The bottom end of the bag is left open, and a few holes punched on
the sides of the bottom half to facilitate drainage. About one cube of soil is required to fill about 1000
sleeves.

Bigger polythene sleevs of 30 cm or 12 inches long and 15 cm or 6 inches wide (layflat) are used to
raise bigger plants for infilling purposex as they are kept longer duration (15 - 18 months) in the
nursery.

 
When filling the sleeves, a small layer of lightly wet soil is gently rammed at the bottom to make it hold
on to the sleeve. Then fill by gently pressing the soil in but not ramming it hard, to avoid formation of a
hard layer that may impede root development. No air pockets shouid be left in the soil while filling as it
could result in sagging of the bag.

. Source of planting material
Vegetatively propagated plants are raised from internodai cuttings consisting of one leaf of the shoot.
The choice of cultivars, both for replanting and infilling, will depend on the desired characters. Please
tefer TRI Advisory Circular PN 1 for details on selecting suitable cultivars. Cuttings should be obtained
from properly managed multiplication plots (mother bushes) as described below.

9.1 Preparation of mother bushes and planting of cuttings
It is recommended to remove the terminal buds, about 2 - 3 weeks before taking shoots off the
mother bushes and then followed by a foliar application of Zinc Sulphate and Urea at 2 - 3% each
in order to break dormancy of axillary buds and stimulate growth. Please refer TRI Advisory Circular
No. SP 4 for details on fertilizing mother bushes.

9.2 Collection of shoots
Shoots must be obtained from pruned bushes over four years in age. Vigorously grown erect shoots
will be available for collection about four months after pruning in the low country and six months
after pruning in the up country. However, this period may vary with weather conditions, elevation
and cultivar. Generally 3 - 5 suitable cuttings per shoot (depending on the quality of shoot) and 15
- 25 shoots could be obtained from a well maintained mother bush. Approximately 70 - 100 cuttings
could be obtained from a bush. Shoots should be collected early in the day.

9.3 Transportation of shoots
Once shoots are removed from mother bushes they should be kept in a shaded place preferably in
a container filled with water to avoid drying up. Adequate measures should therefore be taken to
minimize drying up and sun scorch of shoots during transportation.

9.4 Method of taking cuttings
Only single node cuttings from a suitable shoot (Figure 2) are recommended. Cuttings should be
taken from the middle portion (Figure 1) of the shoot leaving the apical tender portion and the basal
mature portion (Figure 1). Cuttings with axilliary flower buds, overgrown shoots and damaged mother
leaf (Figure 3) should be discarded. When obtaining single node cuttings, the upper cut should

cut sloping upwards just
above the axillary bud

 

cut sloping downwards —~____,

Figure 2. A suitable single node cutting

damaged mature leaf overgrown axillary bud flower bud
stem too short stem too long excess stem ahead the leaf

Figure 3. Unsuitable cuttings

 
always be made in the shoot closer to the axilliary bud without damaging it (Figure 2). The second
cut should be made 2.5 - 3.8 cm below the node, in an upward slope by rotating the shoot between
fingers. The cuttings should be dropped into a water container immediately after the cut and planted
soon as possible without leaving them to dry out.

9.5 Planting of cuttings
Soil in the polythene bags should be lightly watered and gently pressed prior to inserting cuttings.
Only one cutting should be planted per bag by inserting vertically down into the soil. Planting of
cuttings should be done in the manner the leaves are oriented in one direction at an angie to the
row. The soil around the cutting should be gently pressed by fingers to ensure firm anchorage.
Cuttings of different cultivars should be planted separately and labeled.

9.6 Promotion of rooting of cuttings
In order to enhance callusing and rooting of cuttings particularly in the case of slow rooting cultivars,
the basal ends of the cuttings may be treated with a quick dip of a growth hormone by immersing
the cuttings up to 1.5 cm in Indol Butric acid (IBA) solution of 6000 ppm (6g IBA/L of water).

9.7 Propagation under sealed polythene
Propagation could be done under a sealed polythene tunnel to have considerable savings on water
and labour. After cuttings are planted, the bags as well as beds are given a through watering and
covered immediately with a transparent, 300 gauge polythene sheet, resting on semi-circular iron
or bamboo hoops. The edges of the sheet are buried well on all four sides and made air-tight to
create a propagating environment.

No watering is required in the tent as the water applied initially would be adequate for internal
circulation within the tent. If the moisture in the tent is inadequate, the plants should be watered and
sealed again. When the water is condensed inside the tent, they should be placed back in the
potted bags by gently tapping the surface of the tent at frequent intervals especially in the mornings.

The cover could be retained for 1‘/, - 3 months, depending on the rate of growth, and removed in
stages extending over a few days. This system brings about a relatively fast vegetative growth of
the cuttings, especially in slow-growing cultivars as well as in nurseries in exposed or cold areas.

10. Shade for nurseries
Cuttings should not be exposed to direct sunlight and diffused or indirect sunlight of about 20 - 25%
light is adequate. The different types of nursery shade are described below.

10.1Low shade with bracken fern
Bracken fern (Gleichenia linearis) can be inserted in clusters of about 2 - 3 fern shoots between
polythene sleeves. The fern stalk should be free from leaves up to 25 cm from bottom and shade
should be provided by the fern canopy above this height. Uneven shading and difficulty in supervision
are drawbacks of this type of shade.

10.2Low shade with coir matting
Coir matting of 6mm mesh, with a standard size of 9 m x 3 m (30"" x 9"") is laid on a frame of iron
or bamboo hoops, fixed across the length of the bed at 2 m apart. Rods, 2 m long with loops at the
end, are used to link the hoops together and provide additional support.
10.3High shade with coir matting
Though the initial cost is high, this type of shade is preferred as it allows easy walking in and
carrying out nursery operations under the permanent structure. The frame (wood, galvanized
piping or concrete posts) is erected slightly sloping to receive more of the morning sunlight, and
also to prevent excessive drip during heavy rains. Posts are 2.4 m high, spaced 3.6 m x 3.5 m
apart, and the frame stands 2 m above the bed after erecting. Coir matting of 6mm mesh should
be used as shade material. Alternatively synthetic nettings could be used in high elevation estates.

11. Aftercare operations
11.1 Watering
In the early stages, regular watering two to three times a day is necessary and watering should be
regulated depending on the weather. Wetting the coir matting will help retention of moisture in the
nursery.

11.2 Fertilizer applications
Fertilizer should be applied only after the cuttings have been rooted, which would be between six
to eight weeks in the Low country and ten to twelve weeks in the Up country. Please refer
Advisory Circular No. SP 1 for details of fertilizer application.

11.3 Restacking plants
For easy management of the nursery and to obtain piants uniform in size, the plants should be
separated by restacking them into two to three height classes during the fourth to fifth month. A
second restacking could be done during the fifth to seventh month. While restacking, the moss
and hard crust formed in the surface soil of the nursery bags should be loosened by gently dibbling
in with a pointed stick to permit better percolation of water and fertilizer. This leaves the soil in a
friable condition.

11.4 Hardening of plants
As more leaves are formed, plants need exposure to more sunlight for better growth. This must
be done gradually as sudden exposure may lead to leaf scorch. Between the fourth and sixth
month (based on the elevation), the side of the coir matting should be raised and the plants
should be exposed to indirect sun until the shade is completely removed.

11.5 Encouraging early spread
For maximum gain, plants should be encouraged to form a low spread at an early stage. The

following operations would encourage formation of lateral branches from the lower level of the
main stem.

Disbudding: To induce effective lateral branching, the terminal bud should be removed at four
to five leaf stage. This should be repeated on the axillary shoots also as they grow.

Thumb-nailing: At about seventh to eighth leaf stage, after the root system is well developed,
the terminal bud and the two leaves immediately below should be pinched off to induce growth of
lateral branches.

11.6 Pest and disease control
Common pests found in nurseries are the tea tortrix and the yellow mite. When the nursery period
is extended, shot hole borer can become a problem in susceptible cultivars. Mealy bugs may

7

 
become problematic under ifl-drained and clayey soil conditions. Blister blight and black blight
disease (in the Low country) on young leaves during monsoon condition also can be a probiem.
Please refer TRI PM and DM series of Advisory Circulars for current recommendations on control
of insect and mite pests and, leaf diseases in nurseries.

With proper timing of operations along with good management practices, nursery tea plants with
appropriate quality standards can be produced within a period of 10 - 12 months in Up country
and Uva regions, and 8 - 9 months in Low country regions.

ADVISORY CIRCULAR _No.PT

 

Date of Issue: September 2003 Serial No: 14/03

TROUGH - WITHERING OF TEA
(This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No. T1, Serial No. 6/71)

1. Introduction

Trough withering of tea leaf is recommended for all tea growing districts in Sri Lanka. At the
initial stages, tats were used for withering, but they are obsolete now.

This Circular addresses factories, which have trough installations. Those considering trough
installations in new factories must request for advice specific to individual cases. They are
therefore, excluded from the scope of this Circular.

2. Factors to be considered before troughs are installed in a loft
2.1. Dimensions of troughs:
The standard width of troughs is 6 ft. (1.8 m) but the length can be varied to suit the loft.

Alternatively, the length could match the capacity of one roller (charge) or a small
multiple thereof. The objective is to make the maximum use of the available floor space.

2.2. Trough capacity:

Trough capacity is computed on the basis of 2.5 kg/sq.ft. (approx. 27 kg green leaf per
sq.m). For example, a trough 6' (1.8 m) wide and 50° (15.24 m) in length would have
300 sq.ft. (27.4 sq.m). of withering area and the following capacities:

Normal capacity 300 x 2.5 = 750kg

The maximum could be at the rate of 3 kg/sq.ft. (32.3 kg/sq.m)

The maximum capacity 300 x 3.0 = 900 kg
2.3 Air requirements:

Fans should be capable of delivering 0.56 cu.m. of air per minute per kg (20 cfm/kg) of
fresh leaf at a pressure of approximately 0.5 inches (13 mm) water gauge (WG). A fan
coupled to a trough carrying 750 kg of green leaf should therefore, be capable of
delivering a minimum throughput of 420 cu.m per minute (approx. 1500 cfm) at a
pressure of 13 mm WG.

2.4 Other considerations:

= There should be a clearance of at least half a fan diameter between the cold air intake of
each fan and any obstacle, of sizeable proportion.

= In the case of fans of two troughs facing each other, partitioning fan and chamber should
be avoided to minimize fan starvation.

= Allow a working space at least 0.60 m between troughs.

1
« The area of the hot air intake should approximate that of the cold air intake.

* The trough should be sited in such a way that the hot air intake is not too distant from
the drier discharge. First-floor lofts are the most convenient for trough installation. The
floor should be devoid of damages. A floor sealed with an extra 26 gauge GI sheet is
useful.

3. Use of troughs for withering tea leaf

The leaf should be sp'read at a rate of 2.5 kg/sq.ft' subject to a maximum of 3 kg/sq.ft
immediately on arrival at the factory. It is very important that the leaf should be spread
uniformly throughout the length of a trough and the fan turned on as soon as spreading
operation is complete. If there is heat build up in the leaf, loading should done with the fan on.

3.1 Wet leaf:

Regulate the cold and hot air dampers to give the maximum throughput of air at a
hygrometric difference of 8 to 10°F (approx. 4.5 to 5.5°C) for approximately 1 - 2 hours
depending on the wetness. Surface moisture should have been removed by this time.
The leaf can now be turned over gently loosening all 'lumps'. Reduce the hygrometric
difference to about 4 - 6°F (approx. 2.2 - 3.3°C) at this stage and turn the leaf for the
second time when the layer of leaf at bottom is almost withered.

3.2 Dry bulb:

Regulate the dampers as before to give an under-bed hygrometric difference of 4 - OF.
It would be adequate if the leaf was turned once when the layer of leaf at the bottom is
almost withered. The fans should be switched off when the leaf is being turned over.

During periods of prolonged dry weather, ambient hygrometric differences may exceed
6°F. Under these conditions, a short wither is inevitable and night manufacture may have
to be resorted to, short withers would suit estates going through their quality season as
they would invariably be conducting night manufacture, but elsewhere, if there is no
justification for conducting night manufacture, the troughs should be operated with the
hot air dampers fully closed and with the cold air dampers also partially closed. A higher
spreading rate would also assist in delaying the wither.

If the wither is complete but the leaf cannot be immediately charged into a roller for some
reason, and if there is heat build up in the leaf, it is preferable to operate the fans leaving the
doors at the gable (fan) end of the trough full open. The trickle of air passing through the leaf in
this condition would surface to keep the leaf from heating, but would not be adequate to permit
any appreciable withering to take place.

 

""The spreading rate is intentionally given as kg/sq. ft, as factory staff are more conversant with this
combination than kg/sq.m
ie
Use of lofts

If there is no surface moisture in the leaf, the evening leaf should be spread on the ‘st loft. If
there is surface moisture in the leaf, the leaf could be spread on troughs with hot air intakes
situated near the drier. Consideration can also be given to spreading the leaf on the troughs in
such a manner as to prevent exposure of leaf to direct sunlight.

4. Energy usage

Bulk of electricity consumption in black tea processing takes place in the unit operation of
withering. Installation of speed controllers to trough fans is recommended, to reduce the
electricity consumption in withering, by about 40%. It is always recommended to use harmonic
filters with these speed controllers to minimize the damage to the machinery.
Capacitors/capacitor banks can cause harmonics in the power supply.

5. General

The practice of emptying leaf bags on the floor before loading the trough is discouraged. It is far
better to empty these bags directly on the troughs because this ease the operation and
minimizes handling and bruising of the leaf, which could lead to premature fermentation.

Reversible switchgear is of limited use in troughs and as such not recommended. Turning the
leaf by hand gives a more satisfactory wither.

Wider troughs with more than 6' (1.82 m) are not recommended due to difficulties in handling
green leaf during the operations of loading, loosening, turning and unloading. Such difficulties
result in uneven withers and hence the quality of tea produced suffers.

Insurance regulations permit the installation of tube lights in lofts equipped with troughs. This is
of great benefit.

All windows in the loft should be fitted with wire mesh or nylon netting to prevent birds entering.
Insect traps too need to be fitted in the loft to prevent insect approaching the lights in the night.

ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.PT EE

 

Date of Issue: September 2003 Serial No: 15/03

MANUFACTURE OF TEA BY THE CTC PROCESS

(This Advisory Circular replaces Circular Nos. T3, Serial No. 11/72 and T4, Serial No. 12/72)

A high standard of plucking is important for good CTC manufacture, not only to ensure teas of a
satisfactory liquoring standard, but also to prevent the CTC rollers from becoming prematurely
blunt by cutting into coarse leaf, stalk and woody material.

Withering

Green leaf is given a light wither, corresponding to about 28-32% outturn of made tea to
withered leaf, in troughs. It is important that the wither should not get harder than an upper limit
of 32% to ensure a satisfactory make, even if a drastic reduction in the duration of wither is
necessary The withered leaf is then passed over a withered leaf sifter with a No. 4 (or a larger
mesh) to eliminate sand and small stones that may have got picked up accidentally in the field
and in the weighing sheds.

Cutting

The leaf is fed into a pre-conditioner such as 15"" (380 mm) rotorvane and then given 3 or more
successive cuts in CTC machines arranged in series. It is advisable to use a bar magnet on the
conveyor to the first CTC machine connected to remove iron particles, which might damage the
rollers. Arrangement sketches, details of roller adjustments, rolling programmes etc., are given
in other circulars.

Fermentation

The period of fermentation is generally shorter than with conventional manufacture, ranging
from 1 hour 15 minutes to about 2 hours 10 minutes depending on the rate of fermentation of
the leaf. Fermentation machines with a forced draught of air could be used, but it is also
possible to ferment the leaf on tables, by reducing the spread to 25 mm - 32 mm (1 to 1%
inches) in height. Fermented dhool can then be fed into the drier directly. It is however,
advisable to pass it first through a ball-breaker as this operation minimizes the formation of
agglomerates which inevitably find their way into the off grades.

Drying

The drying process is carried out in either a Fluid-Bed Drier (FBD) or in a conventional ECP
drier. However, FBD is considered to be sine quo non for CTC manufacture. If FBD is used the
inlet temperature should be maintained at 121 - 126°C and the weir end temperature at 88 -
93°C with a weir height of 8.9 - 10.2 cm. If ECP drier is used the period of drying should be 21
minutes with an inlet temperature of 93 - 99°C and exhaust temperature of 52 - 54°C.

Grading

The grading operation is simplified by the absence of a big bulk, and by the manufacture of only
a limited number of grades. Generally, either a Vibro Screen or a Chota Sifter or a Trinick Sorter
with mesh sizes of 10, 12, 16, 30 and 40 is used. When a Chota Sifter or a Vibro Screen is
used, tea particles passing over the 12 mesh are crushed, resifted and classified in secondary
grades. BP‘ is taken through 12 and over the 16 mesh. What passes through 16 and over the
30 mesh is PF1 and through 30 and over 40 is PD. What passes through 40 mesh is D1.
Some variation is expected in the sieve size description of grades and even in sifting procedure
according to trade requirements, but the procedure outlined here is that which is most
commonly followed. Crushed teas, rejects from the winnower (if used for subsequent cleaning
operations) and the electrostatic stalk extractor are used to form the off grades BP1, F1 and F2
and D2.

The trays in a Trinnik sorter should be fixed in an ascending order of perforation sizes (No. 30,
24, 16,12) and grades separated as explained above. For example, BP1 is taken through
No. 12. Trinnick sorters could be used with only 4 sizes of meshes fitted, if necessary.

Bright infusions with good fiquoring colour and strength are necessary attributes of a good CTC
tea, but the dry leaf appearance standard is not as important a factor as with orthodox.

AREAS SUITABLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CTC TEA IN SRI LANKA

Increasing popularity of the tea bag in Europe and the demand for quick brew teas have
resulted in the formation of a very considerable market for cut/tear/curl (CTC) teas. A negligible
proportion of this type of tea is manufactured in Sri Lanka and it has now become very
necessary for us to take a serious view of this expanding market. Strong, coloury liquors are
essential characteristics, but dry leaf appearance is not as important as sales factor as it is with
teas of orthodox manufacture.

The requirements of this specialized market for CTC tea are, at the moment, supplied by India
and East Africa. CTC tea production in India is based largely in the low elevational districts of
Assam, Dooars and West Bengal in the North East, and in more limited quantities, from the
plain tea producing areas of Kerala and Madras State in the South. Districts such as Darjeeling,
Nilgiris and the Anamalais which produce flavoury teas in season, and high quality teas for most
of the year retain almost exclusively the orthodox system of manufacture. East Africa, on the
other hand, experiences no pronounced flavoury season as in the Uva and Dimbula-Dickoya
districts of Ceylon, and produces mainly the CTC variety.

Looking into the factors which have demarcated CTC producing areas from districts producing
orthodox black teas in other countries, it would seem that estates in the low and low-mid
elevations of Sri Lanka would be those best suited for producing the type of CTC tea that would
find its way into the tea bag. Rush and other off-season teas from high and upper-mid
elevational teas could also be converted into CTC but these estates would then have to be
geared for dual manufacture and the very best of these could even be placed in a
disadvantages position, under prevailing market conditions, by not offering the trade an
uninterrupted supply of a given line of manufacture.

CALIBRATION OF INFRA-RED MOISTURE METER
(This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No. T6, Serial No. 1/81)

The internationally accepted standard method of moisture determination of tea is the oven
method. A weighed sample of tea is kept in an oven controlled at 103 + 2°C for a minimum of
four hours and is weighed again. The difference in weight is the weight of moisture in the
sample and this is quoted as a percentage of the original weight. This method though accurate
is time-consuming and is not suitable for routine use in tea factories.

There are several types of moisture meters, which give a quick reading, but with lower
accuracy. These instruments, however, are suitable for routine use. One such instrument is the
Infra-red Moisture Meter. In this instrument, the moisture in the tea sample is driven off by the
heat from the infra-red lamp. Initially, only the moisture is driven off but subsequently the tea is
burnt. Therefore, the time for which the sample should be dried is critical in order to get a
reasonably accurate value of the moisture content. It is not correct to dry the sample until such
time that traces of smoke are seen, as this cannot be observed accurately. The switch-ON
time, the time for which the sample should be dried, is determined by the calibration procedure
given below.

It is advisable to calibrate the moisture meter at the factory itself as the calibration depends on
the particle size of the tea, power supply, voltage etc.

Procedure for Calibration
1 Level the meter using a spirit level.

2. Check the scale at various points using actual weights. Slight adjustments may be
necessary using the knob provided.

3. Adjust the height of the bulb so that tea will just start to burn (smoke) in about 10
minutes after switching on the bulb and note this position. This will ensure that the
required switch-on time is well within 10 minutes.

4. Collect some fired dhools from the drier mouth and divide into two samples. Send one
sample to the Technology Division of the TRI or to a suitable laboratory for accurate
determination of the moisture content using the Oven method. This sample should be
packed in a tin leaving no air space and sealed with adhesive tape.

5. Place the standard (usually 10g) quantity of the dhool from the second sample on the
moisture meter pan. Switch on the bulb and note the reading every 30 seconds
commencing from 3 minutes to 10 minutes.

6. Repeat as in (5) and take the average of the two sets of readings. If the readings are
too different repeat for consistency.

T.R.I. ADVISORY CIRCULAR ___No.PT JE

 
7. Once the oven-method moisture readings are sent to the estate, read out the time, which
corresponds to the readings obtained as in (6). This is the switch-on time to obtain the
correct moisture reading.

8. The above time spends on the distance of the bulb from the pan, as such, it should be
kept constant as determined in (3).

9. The switch-on time varies with the particle size, therefore the time should be determined
separately for each dhool and each grade.

10. The above time also depends on the power supply voltage, therefore, calibration and
subsequent use of the instrument should be carried out more or less at the same
voitage.

MOISTURE LEVELS OF BLACK TEA
(This replaces the Advisory Circular No. T7, Serial No. 2/81)

The most important factor that determines the keeping qualities of tea is the moisture
content. At high moisture levels the deterioration of the desirable tea characteristics is
faster and these teas are found to lose briskness with time and end up as flat teas. The
moisture content of tea could be kept within the desired limits by the following:

i) Proper drying of tea.

ii) Preventing excessive moisture absorption during grading and,

iii) Packing tea in proper containers such as plywood tea chests lined with
aluminium foil or multiwall paper sacks.

The moisture content of properly fired dhools when sampled at the drier mouth should
be in the region of 3% and that of the tea at the time of packing should preferably be less
than 5%.

In order to dry tea properly, the following operating conditions are recommended for the
ECP Drier and the Fluid Bed Drier (FBD):

ECP

a) Inlet air temperature of 190 -195 °F (88 - 91°C).

b) Exhaust air temperature - recorded by a thermometer placed one-third the length

away from feed end and 6 inches (15.2 cm) above top tray of 125-135 °F (52 —

57°C).

c) Residence time (i.e. time through the drier) of 21 minutes.

d) Air volume of 30 cfm per Ib (1.87 cubic meters per minute per kg) moisture
evaporated per hour, with uniform distribution over the top tray.

e) By-pass valve at fully closed position.

f) Adjustment of feed rate so as to maintain recommended exhaust temperature.

g) The fall through of tea should be minimized by having suitable tray perforations.

D

Th

a) Inlet air temperature of 260 °F (127°C).

b) Height of discharge weir in drier at 3 % - 4 inches (8.9 - 10 cm).

c) Tea bed temperature near discharge end (recorded by a thermo probe immersed
in the tea bed and mounted 6 to 8 inches (15.2 — 20.3 cm) from the discharge
weir of the drying chamber) at 190-200 °F (88 ~ 93°C).

d) Air volume of 2000-2500 cfm (56.6 — 71 cubic meters per minute) per drying
section.

e) Volume control dampers adjusted so as to get well fluidized tea bed in all
sections and,

f) Adjustment of feed rate so as to maintain the recommended tea bed temperature
near discharge end.

~~
The absorption of certain amount of moisture by tea prior to and during grading as well
as packing is inevitable but care should be taken to prevent excessive gain. One of the
first precautions to be taken is to maintain the grading and packing rooms in a
reasonably dry condition. Tea should be graded daily and must not be left exposed
longer than necessary. Un-graded teas should not be left lying about in heaps but should
be stored in covered boxes. Graded teas should be binned as soon as possible.

The determination of moisture content of dhool samples and invoice samples should be
carried out as a routine and records should be maintained. The methods of determining
moisture content of tea and calibration of the Infra-red Moisture Meter are given in
another Advisory Circular.

PESTICIDE (PLANT PROTECTION PRODUCT) USE IN TEA

(This Circular supersedes Advisory Circular No. PU 1, Serial Nos. 03/08, 01/12, 01/15, 01/17, 01/19, 01/20,
01/22 and 01/23, issued in October 2008, June 2012, February 2015, February 2017, July 2019, November
2020, August 2022 and March 2023 respectively)

1. Introduction

Diseases, insect, mite and nematode pests and weeds occur in tea, in different stages of the crop,
and at different times of the year. Therefore, an integrated approach (Integrated Pest
Management: IPM) is recommended for efficient and timely management of pests in tea, which
consists of various agronomic, cultural, biological and chemical strategies in a rational and
environmental friendly manner. Rational use of fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides,
fumigants and weedicides is a part of integrated management of diseases, insects, mites,
nematodes and weeds respectively.

In parallel, it is necessary to strengthen biological systems and improve cultural practices in order
to promote the build-up of tolerance in plant and biological-control organisms in the environment,
and to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests, diseases and weeds in tea fields. Also,
use of tea cultivars resistant / tolerant to the different diseases and pests is the prime component in
the IPM.

As tea is a food commodity for human consumption, there is a growing concern among health-
conscious consumers on pesticide residues that may be present in tea.

Therefore, it is advisable to use pesticides in tea fields carefully, in order to minimize the residues
in made tea, effects on workers and non-target organisms in the eco-system. Moreover, the cost-
effectiveness and the social acceptance of pesticide usage also have to be considered for the
sustainability of the tea industry.

The chemicals and their use in tea as Plant Protection Products (PPPs) are subjected to change
periodically to meet the requirements of consumers, social and environmental acceptance etc. It is
extremely necessary to ensure that the pesticide residues in made tea at levels below the
Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) set for different pesticides by different countries.

When PPPs are applied to tea cultivations, it is necessary to strictly adhere to specific Pre-Harvest
Intervals (PHI) and bulk green leaf from the sprayed and unsprayed fields or made tea at a ratio of
1:10. This would help dilute and minimize the pesticide residues in the made tea. Proper record
keeping and monitoring on rational use of the PPPs are made mandatory for traceability and
regulatory purposes.

2. List of Recommended PPPs

The active substances recommended for control of diseases, insects, mites and nematode pests
and weeds in tea plantations by the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, as at March, 2023 and
respective MRLs of Japan and the EU are given in the Table 1.

Growers are advised to use only the PPPs listed in Table 1 and as per TRI recommendations
given in Advisory Circulars PU 2, PU 3 and PU 4 for management of diseases, weeds and insect,
mite and nematode pests respectively.

CHEMICAL CONTROL OF DISEASES

(This Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PU2 Serial No. 02/23 issued in March 2023 and previous
related circulars and links with Circular Nos. DM1, DM2, DM3, DM4, DM5, DM6 & DM7)

1. Introduction
For disease management in tea, an integrated approach inclusive of cultural, biological and
chemical methods is recommended as specified in Advisory Circulars DM1 — DM7.

Two fundamental groups of fungicides are used to control tea diseases. They are either contact or
systemic. Contact fungicides can kill a pathogen (fungus) only upon contact and are not absorbed
into plant tissues. Systemic fungicides on the other hand have the ability to be absorbed into plant
tissues and therefore may leave behind residues for a longer period with better controllability. This
can become counterproductive when it comes to residues in the final product (made tea).
Therefore, this makes necessary to take all the precautions in resorting to control diseases using
systemic fungicides. It is very important to use only the recommended fungicides as per TRI
guidelines following the required Pre Harvest Interval (PHI).

CHEMICAL CONTROL OF WEEDS IN TEA LANDS

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PU 3, Serial No. 03/23 issued in May 2023 and
previous related circulars and links with Circular No. WM1, Serial No.24/24 issued in February 2024)

Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach includes manual, mechanical, cultural and
chemical methods (in rotation) as specified in TRI Advisory Circular WM 1. The use of herbicides
has some advantages, such as selectivity and cost-effectiveness, but sometime, causes crop
damages, residue issues and environmental problems that need to be avoided by limiting the
number of applications to two rounds per annum and strictly adhering to the recommended rate.

When using herbicides, the TRI recommendations should always be followed along with a
minimum of one week Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI). Precautions should also be taken to avoid spray
drift onto the tea foliage and green stems.

1. Common Weeds

A volume of 450 - 500 L of herbicide solution is required to cover one hectare of tea field when
using a Knapsack sprayer fitted with a nozzle having a swathe of 0.5 — 1 meter at 1 - 2 bars
pressure, while holding the nozzle at 35 - 50 cm above the ground.

3. Guidelines for safe and effective use of herbicides

a) Adopt a selective spraying program in order to retain desirable weeds and to control resistant
weeds. Such resistant weeds should be treated with specific herbicides at dosages
recommended. Alternately, other more effective control measures may be adopted.

&

Select the most suitable herbicide based on the range and growth stage of weed species
present in the field. Use correct dosage of herbicide and mix thoroughly in clean water and then
make up the spray volume required to cover the area to be treated. Wash spray tanks
thoroughly in clean water before use to avoid any contamination.

Maintain the number of herbicide applications for the year to a minimum (maximum two from a
single herbicide), and use a range of herbicides of different mode of action in rotation than
continuing with a single herbicide. This would help in preventing build-up of resistant weed
species.

2

=

Do not spray herbicides on creepers growing over the tea bush. These should be pulled down
and laid on the inter-row space and then sprayed. Mature woody plants and deep-rooted
species should be slashed, and the regrown tender parts to be sprayed.

e) Spray weedicides, when weeds are relatively young, before they flower / bear seeds.

f) Select a calm day for spraying, as wind could carry the spray drift away from the intended area
of spray. Also avoid spraying during very hot period of the day.

g) Use a spray guard when spraying on the inter-rows of tea. This would prevent excessive spray
drift on to peripheral branches and green stems.

h) Use lever operated, diaphragm type Knapsack sprayers which are more appropriate for
herbicide applications. All sprayers must be checked for proper performance and, the trigger
valves and nozzles need to be checked for leaks.

i) Use the correct type of Poly jet / Flood jet nozzles (yellow: swathe 0.5 m, spray output 0.6 L per
minute or green: swathe 1.0 m, spray output 1.2 L per minute).

j) Wear protective clothing when mixing and spraying herbicides.

k) Clean the tank, nozzle and lance after use thoroughly and wash the self and protective clothing
used. Do not throw empty herbicide containers (particularly into streams and waterways).

!) Supervise the entire operation carefully to ensure safe and effective weed control.
m) Store agro-chemicals separately to prevent mishandling.

n) Maintain proper records of purchases, storage, issuance and usage of herbicides.

GREEN MANURE CROPS IN TEA

(This replaces the existing Circular No. 0-3, Serial No. 7/90.)

1.

Objective

Considerable quantities of green manure can be obtained from well-managed medium shade
trees and green'manure crops that are interplanted with tea. Their loppings provide organic
matter in large ‘quantities. The organic matter from loppings improves the soil physical
properties and also provides nitrogen and other mineral nutrients. Lopping should be carried
out at the proper time. The frequency of lopping will depend on the speciés and the agro-
ecological zone in which they are grown.

Loppings of Shade Trees

Medium shade trees such as Erythrina lithosperma (dadaps) and Gliricidia sepium
have a dual purpose in that they afford physical shade to tea and serve as green
manure crops. These trees should be lopped with the onset of rain. Gliricidia could
be lopped 2 — 3 times a year depending on the growth and weather conditions, and
dadap 1- 2 times a year.

Species of Acacia that thrive well in elevations above 1370 m (4500 ft) do not stand
up to hard lopping. They should, therefore, be lopped lightly with the
commencement of rain.

Calliandra grows well up to an elevation of 1500 m (5000 ft) and it could be lopped
1-2 times a year, well before pod set.

Loppings of shade trees should be chopped and spread evenly between tea rows
and not heaped up in several places.

Green Manure

Bush varieties like Crotolaria anagyroides or Crotolaria usaromoensis could be
grown as green manure crops between every four rows of tea in new clearings.
These plants grow fast and attain a height of 1.5 m ( 5 ft) in 3-4 months. They
should be lopped at the time of flowering before pod formation, and the loppings
spread evenly between tea rows. About 2-3 loppings could be done in a year.

As Crotolaria competes with tea for moisture during dry periods, it should be lopped
immediately before the onset of drought.

Sesbania sesban is also recommended as a green manure crop for all elevations.
This particular species is not a threat to tea as far as tea nematodes are concerned.

Apart from protecting the young tea plants from wind damage, the above green
manure species also conserve soil and provide nutrients from their loppings.

SHADE IN TEA

Objectives (This cancels the Circular No. 0-1, Serial No. 5/90, issued in October 1990)

Planting of shade trees has all along been associated with tea cultivation. Shade trees
simulate forest conditions, which are believed to be the natural habitat of tea.

When tea is pruned, the bark of the frame that is shaded by the canopy for 3 - 5 years
gets exposed. In the absence of shade, tea can be subjected to sun scorch. Over
several pruning cycles, the problem of bark scorching also gets aggravated and this
results in a reduction in bud break, weakening of the bush, occurrence of wood rot,
decline in crop and death of the bush during drought. These features are more
prevalent in Uva, some parts of the mid-country and the low-country.

Shade trees serve other purposes as well. For example, in the low-country, Gliricidia
sepium has been found to be a suitable diversionary host to the swarming low-country
live wood termite.

Planting, Establishment and Management

The establishment of shade should be done early during planting of the rehabilitation
grass. This will ensure that there is adequate shade when the young tea is put out in
the field. Shade trees should be planted in the rows where tea is proposed to be
planted in order to facilitate easy movement of labour during various cultural
operations. In addition, the grass surrounding each shade tree should be trimmed
down in order to allow light and prevent smothering by grass.

In mature tea, where there is no shade the best time to plant shade trees are after
pruning the tea. This will facilitate their easy establishment. If planted in mature tea in
plucking, the branches of tea bushes surrounding the shade plant should be cut to
allow adequate light. In addition, the shade plants should be protected by putting up a
fence round each plant or by covering with empty fertilizer bags. Shade trees should
be planted as a mixed stand of high and medium shade.

Establishment of Medium Shade
Calliandra calothrysus
Calliandra calothrysus is recommended for elevations up to 1500 m. It, however,

thrives well in elevations between 300 - 1300 m. Calliandra should be established in
the following manner:

 
3.2

To establish Calliandra directly in new clearings, 3 to 4 seeds should be sown at one
place, on soil mound, where the planting hole is cut to a depth of 45 cm. After the
seeds germinate, the seedlings should be thinned down, leaving one vigorous plant.
Alternatively, seeds could be sown in poly bags and 4 - 6 months old seedlings could
be planted out in the new clearing with the onset of rain.

Initial spacing should be 3.0 m x 3.6 m (10 ft x 12 ft) to enable the plants to give
adequate shade for young tea. At the end of 3 years, they should be thinned down toa
spacing of 6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft).

If more shoots emerge from the base of the plant, they should be thinned out to allow a
maximum of three shoots to grow. This will prevent over shading of tea.

The first lopping could be carried out 18 - 24 months after planting at a height of 2.3 m
(7 ft) from ground. Calliandra withstand lopping well and has good coppicing ability.
Subsequent loppings should be done before the pod set.

Dadap (Erythrina lithosperma) and Gliricidia (Glircidia sepium)

Dadap and Gliricidia are dual-purpose trees, serving as medium shade as well as
green manure crops. While Dadap is recommended for elevations above 600 m (2000
ft), Gliricidia could be grown below 900 m (3000 ft).

Since propagation by seeds is not practicable, both these species are to be established
by planting poles of suitable size and maturity.

The poles used for planting should be obtained from a healthy mature tree and the
trees lopped about 6 - 8 months before poles are cut for planting.

The poles should be 6 - 8 months old and have a girth of 5.0 - 7.5 cm (2 - 3 inch) at
the time of planting. In addition, the branches should be ring-barked at least 6 - 8
weeks before they are taken at the point of cut. It has been observed that failure in
establishment is invariably attributed to the use of over-mature branches. Therefore,
use of any over-mature poles from fences, boundaries and senile trees should be
avoided.

After lopping, the poles should be rested vertically against the mother tree, and not left
horizontally on the drain or on the ground.

The poles should be planted within 48 hours after lopping. Any damage during
transport will reduce the rate of success in establishment. Planting should be done with
the onset of monsoon.

The height of the stump should be 1.8 - 2.0 m (6 - 7 ft) and the basal end should be
buried to a depth of 30 - 40 cm (12 - 15 inch).

Prior to planting, both ends should be given a slanting cut by using a sharp knife.
Planting holes should be 30 cm (12 inch) wide and 45 - 60 cm (18 - 24”) deep. 225g
(8 oz) dolomite should be mixed with soil while filling the hole. It would be advisable to
incorporate 1 kg of compost into each planting hole. The poles should be planted after
making an alavangoo hole. The pole should not be rammed into the planting hole, as
this will cause damage to its bark. After planting, the soil should be well pressed round
the pole. The top end of the pole should be covered with mud or polythene. In order to
discourage the lateral sprouting, the poles should be lime washed with 20% solution of
hydrated lime leaving about 30 cm at the top end of the pole

Dadap and Gliricidia withstand lopping well and have good coppicing. The first lopping
should be done early to avoid the tree becoming top heavy. The first height of lop
should be done at 1.8 m (6 ft) and a crown of branches should be encouraged at the
point of first cut and subsequent cuts. Subsequent loppings should be done at a height
of 45 - 60 cm (18 - 24”) above the previous lopping.

Gliricidia could be lopped 2 - 3 times a year in most parts of the mid- and low-country
while dadap could be lopped 1 - 2 times a year depending on the rate of growth.
Loppings should be preferably done with the commencement of monsoon.

Establishment of High Shade

Grevillea robusta and Albizzia moluccana or Albizzia chinensis are recommended as
high shade tree species. Grevillea robusta can be planted in mid and high elevations
while Albizzia moluccana or Albizzia chinensis can be planted in mid and low
elevations. Albizzia can, however, be established as an interim high shade, even in
the elevation range of 1370 - 1500 m (4500 - 5000 ft)

When interplanted with medium shade species, the high shade trees could be planted
with medium shade falling mid way between two high shade trees.

The planting holes should be 0.6 m (2.0 ft) deep with a top diameter of 0.3 m (1.0 ft)
Dolomite at the rate of 1.0 kg (2.0 Ib) could be incorporated into each planting hole

By the third year, high shade should finally be thinned down to a spacing of 12.0 m x
12.0 m (40 ft x 40 ft) and the medium shade to 6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft).

\t is preferable to plant the shade trees in the tea row to facilitate easy movement of
workers engaged in the various field operations

Both Grevillea and Albizzia seedlings should initially be raised in poly bags and
thereafter planted out in the field with the onset of monsoon.

Management of High Shade

Albizzia trees should be pollarded when they are over 3 years, at a height of 6.0 m (20
ft). In order to encourage good lateral growth, Grevillea trees could be pollarded at a
height of 5 m (15 ft) when they are 10 years old. There after upright branches should
be pollarded annually. it s necessary to leave at least 3-4 healthy branches below the
point of pollarding at different directions, therefore, the height of pollarding may vary
accordingly.

 
The average life span of Grevillea and Albizzia is 30 and 12 years respectively. When
the existing Grevillea is 20 years old and Albizzia 8 years, replacements should be
established.

It is advisable to plant Albizzia moluccana/Albizzia chienensis around large rock
outcrops in the tea field. This will prevent heating up of the rock, which radiates heat
and scorches the tea around and also effectively use the space occupied by the rock
outcrop.

Teas planted in the southern and western slopes of field experience greater warmth
than those on the eastern and northern slopes. Therefore, a denser stand of shade is
recommended for southern and western slopes of a field. For this purpose, the final
spacing of high shade should be 12.0 m x 6.0 m (40 ft x 20 ft) and that of medium
shade 6.0 m x 7.2 m (20 ft x 24 ft).

Removal of old Shade Trees

In order to ensure that the dead trees do not facilitate root diseases, they should be
ting-barked uprooted along with the tea prior to replanting. However, if Gravillea is
under 10 years old or if its girth is below 60 cm (24 inches), it may be retained.

The ring-barked trees, especially Grevillea, be inspected periodically to check whether
there is any bridging up of the gap. New shoots emerging below the point of ring
barking should be removed.

Ring-barking of trees, such as Grevillea, should commence at least 2 years before
felling them.

Felling of shade trees should be done after all the leaves have turned yellow and fallen.
It is preferable not to allow the stumps to remain above the soil and any such stumps
so remaining should be covered with earth after cutting below the soil level.

New shade trees should be planted well before the old ones are removed, so that the
field is not left without shade.

Ring-barking is not necessary if the roots can be completely removed.
Replacement of Shade trees

Generally, in about 10 years Albizzia and 25 years Grevillea shade trees become
unmanageable. Also, pollarding and uprooting of very old trees can lead to heavy
damage t tea. Therefore, shade trees should be replaced every 10-25 years depending
on the species. At a time when tea is being replanted young shade trees less than 10
years in age and less than 60 cm (24 inches) girth could be retained.

WIND AND SHELTER BELTS IN TEA

4. Objectives (This cancels the Circular No.0-2,., Serial No. 6/90, issued in October 1990)

In wind swept areas, it is advisable to establish shelter belts well before the planting
of young tea. The full blast of the wind during the months of heavy blowing could
result in:

e loss of crop in mature tea

e damage to leaf

e poor establishment of new clearings (arising from loosening of young
plants and consequent bark damage at the soil level)

2. Region-specific species

2.11n the up-country, a mixed stand of Grevillea robusta and Hakea saligna or
Acacia spp.is recommended. They should be planted at right angles towards the
direction of wind.

2.2 In the mid —country, a mixed stand of Grevillea and Acacia spp. is recommended.

2.3 Grevillea robusta could be spaced 3.6 m (12 ft) apart in the row. On either side of
Grevillea, Hakea saligna or Acacia spp. could be planted at a spacing of 1.2 —
1.8 m (4-6 ft).Alternatively, rows of Hakea or Acacia alone could be grown as
wind belts at a spacing of 1.2 - 1.8 m (4-6 ft.).

2.4 In the low-country, a mixed stand of Fragrea fragrans and Gliricidia septum is
recommended for wind belts. Fragrea fragrans could be spaced 3.6 — 4.5 m (12-
15 ft) along the row while Gliricida sepium could be planted on either side of
F.frgrans at a spacing of 1.2 — 1.5 m (4-6 ft)

3. Spacing

The spacing between rows of wind belts could be 45 — 60 m (150-200 ft)
depending on the intensity of blowing of the wind. The ideal spacing should be
ten times the height of the wind belt. On hilicrest wind belts consist of double
rows planted on a triangular arrangement is recommended at spacing given
above (para 2.3 and 2.4) for specific spps.

4. Tea as wind belt
In case wind belts are not established, tea itself could be established as wind belt

by allowing it to grow freely. However, the distance should be closer than 45 m
(150 ft)

Issued in: July 2000 Serial No: 00/4
FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NURSERY TEA

This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No. F 9, Serial No. 01/96, issued in
January 1996 on the use of fertiliser for nursery tea plants.

1.0 Introduction

Two nursery mixtures, viz. T65 MAP (containing mono-ammonium phosphate)
and T65 DAP (containing di-ammonium phosphate), are recommended differing
only in the source of phosphate. The option to have two P fertiliser sources is to
allow the grower to use either source depending on its availability in the market.
When both mixtures are available, T65 MAP is preferred as it is easier to handle
because it dissolves faster.

1.1 Composition of nursery mixtures - T65 MAP and T65-DAP

1.1.1 T65 MAP
15 parts Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)
20 parts Mono-ammonium phosphate (20% N and 35% P20s)
15 parts Sulphate of potash (48% K,0)
15 parts Epsom salt (16% MgO)
65 parts
The mixture contains approximately 10.9% N, 10.8% P2Os, 11.1% K2O and 3.7%
MgO.
1.1.2 T65 DAP
20 parts Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)
15 parts Di-ammonium phosphate (18% N, 46% POs)
15 parts Sulphate of potash (48% K20)
15 parts Epsom salt (16% MgO)
65 parts

The mixture contains approximately 10.5% N, 10.6% P2Os, 11.1% KO and 3.7%
MgO.

1.2. Method, dosage and frequency of application

1.2.1 The fertilizer mixture should be applied using watering cans. In view of the limited
solubility of Di-ammonium phosphate in the T65 DAP mixture, the fertiliser should
be well ground and made into a paste prior to dissolving it in the required quantity
of water.

1.2.2 Commencing from the time of rooting (approximately 2 to 3 months after planting
of cuttings), apply 35 g of T65 MAP or T65 DAP in 5 | of water per sq. m. at
fortnightly intervals (1 sq. m. would hold approximately 120 nursery plants).
1.2.3

1.2.4

1.3

1.4

1.4.1

Increase the dosage to 70 g in 5 | of water per sq. m. at fortnightly intervals as
growth progresses (approximately 5 to 6 months after planting of cuttings).

Following each application, wash the foliage with clean water, to avoid scorch of
leaves.

Estimation of T65 requirements

At the above rates of application, the quantity of T65 MAP or T65 DAP required
to raise 10,000 plants is estimated to be 60 to 90 kg, depending on the length of
the nursery period in different regions. An approximate estimate of the quantity of
the mixture required to raise 10,000 plants for low, mid- and up country is given
below:

Length of nursery period Quantity

(months) (kg)
Low country 8 to 10 60 to 80
Mid-country 8 to 10 60 to 80
Up country 10 to 12 80 to 90

Foliar application of zinc sulphate

Foliar application of zinc sulphate is recommended to induce bud break and
activate the growth of nursery plants.

Dosage and frequency of application
About a week after the first application of T65, spray 14 g of zinc sulphate in 4.5!

of water to wet approximately 4500 plants, using knapsack sprayers. Repeat
application at 4 to 6 weeks intervals, up to a maximum of 4 applications.

FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMMATURE TEA

This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No F 9, Serial No. 01/96, issued in
January 1996 on the use of fertiliser for immature tea piants.

1 Introduction

Immature tea plants selected for vigour, apart from other desirable characters,
require generous fertiliser applications in the early stages of growth. Although
immature plants are capable of rapid development, their root systems are small
and occupy only a small soil volume from which the nutrients can be absorbed.
An adequate supply of the necessary nutrients should, therefore, be made
available for best results.

Fertilizer mixture T200 is recommended for immature tea from field planting to
the commencement of plucking. A separate fertiliser mixture, T750, with a higher
proportion of nitrogen is recommended from commencement of plucking to the
first prune. Special attention should be given to the methods and frequency of
application. The amelioration of soil pH with dolomitic limestone is also an
important operation during the immature phase.

2 Application from field planting to commencement of plucking

2.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone
Application of dolomitic limestone is recommended for the maintenance of soil pH
levels between 4.5 and 5.5 for better growth of tea.

2.1.1 Specifications
The dolomitic limestone must have a minimum of 18% MgO, and approximately
100% of particles passing through 30 mesh, and 40 to 60% of particles passing
through 100 mesh.

2.1.2 Application
Check the soil pH at the time of planting. If the pH level is below 4.5 in spite of
dolomitic limestone application during rehabilitation, apply 500 kg of dolomite per
ha in both the 1st and 2nd years, preferably during wet weather conditions.

There should be an_ interval of 4 to 6 weeks between the ground fertiliser
application and dolomite application.

50 parts Eppawela rock phosphate (28.5% P2Os)
25 parts Muriate of potash (60% K20)

_25 parts Kieserite (24% MgO)

200 parts

The mixture contains approximately 10.3% N, 6.9% P20s, 7.5% K,0 and 3.0%
MgO.

Dosage and frequency of application

Approximately two months after planting, apply T200 at the rates of 15 or 21g
per plant per application six or four times in the 1st year, and 21 or 32 g per plant
per application six or four times in the 2nd year.

Estimation of T200 requirements

At the above rates of application, the quantities of T200 mixture required per ha
(12,500 plants) are approximately:

1100 kg in the 1“ year, and
1600 kg in the 2” year

The quantities of nutrients supplied in the 1st and 2nd year are given below.

Amount of T200 Number Approximate quantities

21g 4 113 76 83 33
2™ year 21g 6
32g 4 165 110 120 48

Time of application

Where favourable weather conditions prevail, frequent applications of fertiliser are
desirable, i.e. six doses per year. In areas with prolonged dry periods, four doses
per year may be possible.

Application of fertiliser in relation to weather is important. If it is applied during
periods of heavy rain, there is a possibility of it being washed away, particularly if
the land is exposed. Fertiliser application during long periods of dry weather should
be avoided to prevent scorch or even death of young plants.
2.2.5

2.3

2.3.1

2.3.2

Method of application

In the early stages, fertiliser should be applied in a ring round the plant, at a radius
of 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8”). Care should be taken not to apply fertiliser too close to the
base of the plant as this would result in bark scorch. In steep areas, fertiliser should
be applied in a semi-circle on the upper slopes.

Fertiliser should be dibbled into the soil to a depth not exceeding 7.5 cm (3”).
Foliar applications

Foliar applications of fertiliser should be made with knapsack sprayers.

Zinc sulphate

Zinc sulphate is recofhmended at the rate of 4 to 6 kg per ha per year, in four to six
applications in the 1st year, i.e. 1 kg in 100 | of water per ha per application, within 7
- 14 days after ground fertiliser application. The quantity of ZnSO, and water should
be doubled for each of the four to six applications in the 2nd year, i.e. 2 kg in 200 |
of water per ha per application.

Nitrogen and magnesium

If deficiency symptoms of nitrogen (general yellowing) and/or magnesium
(interveinal chlorosis in lower maintenance foliage) are observed, apply 1 to 2 % of
urea and/or 1 to 2% of commercial Epsom salt. Apply 1 to 2 kg of urea and 1 to 2
kg of commercial Epsom salt per ha in 100 | of water in the 1st year, and 2 to 4 kg
of each per ha in 200 | in the 2nd year, as and when necessary.

Zinc sulphate, urea and commercial Epsom salt can be mixed together and applied
as a single foliar spray, when required. However, do not exceed 5% total salt
concentration in the final spray solution.

(N.B. Zinc sulphate and Epsom salt are both salts)

Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects

Sulphate of potash is recommended for application prior to dry spells.

A 2% solution of sulphate of potash (i.e. 2 kg in 100 | of water) is recommended
at fortnightly intervals, at least a month prior to the onset of the dry period. Urea
(2%) may be included in the spray solution to enhance absorption of potassium.
No benefits could result from this foliar spray, if carried out after dry weather has
set in.

Zinc sulphate should not be mixed with sulphate of potash in the spray solution.

 
3 Application from commencement of plucking to the ist prune

3.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone
Check the soil pH when the tea is brought into bearing.
If the pH is below 4.5, apply 750 kg of dolomite per ha. The next dolomite
application should be carried out at the time of the 1st prune, preferably a few
weeks before pruning.

3.2 Mixture - T750

3.2.1. Composition

500 parts Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)
100 parts Eppawela rock phosphate (28.5% R2Os)
100 parts Muriate of potash (60% K,0)
_50 parts Kieserite (24% MgO)
750 parts

The mixture contains approximately 13.7% N, 3.7% P2Os, 8.0% K2O0 and 1.6% MgO.
3.2.2 Dosage and frequency of application

Apply T750 at the rate of 1,750 kg per ha per year from the 3rd year onwards
until the 1st prune, in four or more applications.

The quantities of nutrients supplied are:
Nutrient (kg per ha per year)

N P,Os KO MgO
240 65 140 28

3.2.3. Method of application

At the end of 2 to 3 years, the tea should normally have been brought into plucking
and should by then form a good cover. The fertiliser could therefore be broadcast.

3.3 Foliar applications
3.3.1 Zinc sulphate
Zinc sulphate is recommended at the rate of 6 to 9 kg per ha per year until the 1“

prune. It can be applied in four to six applications, at 1.5 kg in 300 to 400 | of water
per ha per application, within 7 — 14 days after ground fertiliser application.
3.3.2

3.3.3

Nitrogen and magnesium

If deficiency of nitrogen (general yellowing) and magnesium (interveinal chlorosis
in lower maintenance foliage) are observed, apply 2 to 4% of urea and 2 to 4%
commercial Epsom salt at the rate of 8 to 12 kg of each per ha in 300 to 400 | of
water until the 1% prune, as and when necessary. The quantity of urea and
commercial Epsom salt could be adjusted depending on the severity of deficiency
symptoms. However, do not exceed 5% total sait concentration in the final spray
solution.

Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects

A 2% solution of sulphate of potash (i.e. 6 to 8 kg in 300 to 400 | of water) is
recommended at fortnightly intervals, at least a month prior to the onset of the
dry period. Apply the solution after harvesting to ensure its proper deposit on the
mature foliage. Urea (2%) may be included in the spray solution to enhance
absorption of potassium.

Zinc sulphate should not be mixed with sulphate of potash in the spray solution.

1 Introduction

Balanced nutrition plays a key role in the maintenance of tea plantations. The
cost of fertiliser application varies from 6 to 12% of the total cost of production.
Hence, cost-effective investment in fertiliser is necessary to manage a plantation
as a commercially viable enterprise.

The response of the tea plant to NPK fertilisers is influenced by several factors
such as climate, soil, plant and cultural practices. These factors vary widely
between tea growing regions and therefore the plant response to fertiliser is
different in different tea growing regions. In the present fertiliser
recommendations for mature tea, regional differences have been taken into
consideration in order to optimise productivity and profitability of the land.

2.0 Amelioration of soil pH in mature tea fields

The maintenance of suitable soil pH levels is an important practice in soil fertility
management.

2.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone

Application of dolomitic limestone is recommended to maintain soil pH between 4.5
and 5.5.

The soil pH should be checked prior to every prune, and the rates of dolomite
indicated below should be applied depending on pH level, preferably a few weeks
before pruning.
3.1

Soil pH Dolomite (kg/ha)

Below 3.9 2500
From 3.9 up to 4.2 2000
From 4.2 up to 4.5 1500
Above 4.5 1000
Specifications

The dolomitic limestone must have a minimum of 18% MgO, and approximately
100% of particles passing through 30 mesh, and 40 to 60% of particles passing
through 100 mesh.

Plant Response to ground applied nutrients

The optimum range of N, P and K nutrients (kg/ha/yr) required by seedling and
VP teas for maximum yield response in different tea growing regions are given in
Table 1.

Basal mixtures

To supply the required nutrients, three basal mixtures have been formulated
separately for seedling and VP tea. The designation of each mixture identifies the
type of tea and the region.

Designation

ST/UM - Seedling tea mixture for up and mid-country
ST/LC - Seedling tea mixture for low country

ST/UVA - Seedling tea mixture for Uva

VP/UM - Mature VP tea mixture for up and mid-country
VP/LC - Mature VP tea mixture for low country

VP/UVA - Mature VP tea mixture for Uva

VP/UVA 945 28.6% N, 3.8% P20; and 14.8% K,0

3.2 Fertiliser applications based on ""potential yield”

Calculation of annual N-fertiliser requirement for a given tea field is based on
""potential yield”. The annual potential yield may be defined as the highest yield
achieved in the particular year of the pruning cycle, based on the immediate past
three cycles.

The application of fertiliser to mature seedling or VP fields should be based on such
calculated potential yields. The method of calculation of potential yield for every 12-
month period from prune is given below:

Tabulate the annual yield data of each field (kg made tea per ha per year) over the
previous 3 cycles (15 years, if the cycle has 5 years). However, if data is not
available for three cycles, the data of the past two cycles may be used.

 
An example is given in Table 2.

Table 2 - Yield record of 12-month periods from pruning (kg made tea/ha/yr)

Year after prune
Cycle ist 2nd 3rd 4th Sth
1st 1037 2053 1941 1708 926
2nd 884 1893 1826 1573 866
3rd 990 2140 2090 1650 895

The highest achieved yield (potential yield) for a given year in the cycle is
underlined. These are 1037, 2140, 2090, 1708 and 926 for the 1%, 2"", 3 4"", 5”
year, respectively.

Select the N-level corresponding to each of the potential yields from Table 3.

Table 3 - Annual requirementof nitrogen for the potential yield

Potential yield Requirement of nitrogen
(kg made tea per ha per year) (kg N per ha per year)
Less than 900 90
900-1300 140
1300-1500 160
1500-1700 180
1700-1900 200
1900-2000 220
2000-2500 270
2500-3000 320
3000-3500 360
Above 3500 400

The quantity of nitrogen to be applied in the respective years is therefore:

1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th
12months 12 months 12 months 12months 12months
Potential yield 1037 2140 2090 1708 926
N to be
applied
(kg per 140 270 270 200 140
ha per year)

Once the quantity of nitrogen per ha per year is determined for each field, the
quantity per application is calculated according to the number of applications that is
practically possible. The number of applications should be determined on the basis
of the agro-climatic conditions, as well as on the cropping pattern of the relevant
region.

Quantity of nutrients, basal mixture and urea, application frequencies and
dosages

The quantities of nutrients required, inclusive of the basal mixture and urea, and
the applicable frequencies and dosages corresponding to the potential yield
category for seedling and VP teas, are given in Tables 4 and 5.

Foliar and other ground fertiliser applications

Foliar applications of fertiliser for mature tea should be made with knapsack
sprayers.

Zinc sulphate

Zinc sulphate is recommended at the rate of 6 and 11 kg per ha per year, for fields
yielding less than, and above, 2000 made tea kg per ha per year, respectively.
This should be done in four applications, i.e. 1.5 and 2.75 kg in 400 | of water per
ha per application. Zinc sulphate should be applied within 7 — 14 days after ground
fertiliser application.

Other nutrients

If deficiency symptoms of nitrogen (general yellowing) are observed, apply 2 to 4%
of urea. Apply 8 to 16 kg of urea per ha in 400 | of water, as and when necessary.

If deficiency symptoms of manganese (interveinal chlorosis and reddish brown
necrotic spots on leaf blade) are observed, test the soil pH. If it is above 5.5,
apply 2% manganese sulphate until symptoms disappear, preferably at 3 to 4
week intervals. In addition, withhold the scheduled application of dolomite.

Epsom salt and kieserite for correcting magnesium deficiency

When magnesium deficiency symptoms are observed, spray commercial Epsom
salt initially, at the rate of 48 kg per ha per year in four applications, at intervals
of three months.

Commercial Epsom salt, zinc sulphate and urea can be mixed together and
applied as a single foliar spray, when required. The quantity of urea and Epsom
salt could be adjusted depending on the severity of deficiency symptoms.
However, do not exceed 5% total salt concentration in the final spray solution.

(N.B. Zinc sulphate and Epsom salt are both salts.)
After application of the above, test the soil for Mg content. If it is below the critical

level (60 ppm), apply kieserite at the rate of 125 kg per ha per year by mixing
with basal NPK mixture or with urea in situ.

3.4.4 Soil application of boron

When symptoms of boron deficiency are observed in shade trees, borate (borax)
is recommended at the rate of 4.5 kg per ha per year. Borate should be mixed
with basal NPK mixture or urea in situ.

3.4.5 Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects

Sulphate of potash is recommended for mature tea, to be applied prior to an
anticipated drought and in areas that are prone to frequent drought damage.

A 2% solution of sulphate of potash (i.e. 8 kg in 400 | of water) is recommended
at fortnightly intervals, commencing at least a month prior to the onset of the dry
period. Spray immediately after harvesting to ensure proper deposition on the
mature foliage. Urea (2%) may be included in the spray solution to increase the
efficiency of potassium absorption.

Zinc sulphate should not be mixed with sulphate of potash in the spray solution.

Soi ANALysis
(This Circular cancels Advisory Circular No. S3, Serial No. 5/84, issued in 1984)

1. Introduction
Nutrient status of soil can be determined by soil analysis. The corrective measures to amend or
improve nutrient deficiencies can be based on results of such analysis. However, soil analysis only
may not be adequate to make recommendations as there are several other factors that govern the
availability of nutrients.

Soil analysis may be resorted to, when it is suspected that the soil is the primary cause for poor
performance of tea bushes. Other factors such as fertilizer application, cultural practices, etc. should
have been correctly adhered to. Under such circumstances, a complete analysis of soil is likely to
reveal the factor which causes poor growth.

For Site Specific Fertilizer Recommendation (SSFR), soil analyses are compulsory because SSFR
mainly depends on soil nutrient status.

For soil analysis to be reliable for decision making, soil should have been sampled correctly. Therefore,
due regard must be paid to the sampling procedure outlined below.

2. Sampling for nutrient analysis

The collection, preparation and delivery of a soil sample are important steps in the analytical operation.

2.1 Time of sampling
For the estimation of soil pH levels and/or nutrient status, sampling should be carried out after
a minimum period of 6 weeks following the last ground fertilizer application. At the time of
sampling, soil should be relatively moist. Sampling should be avoided during severe drought
and heavy rainfall seasons. In the case of SSFR, representative soil samples should be obtained
annually to determine the nutrient status. Samples for SSFR can be obtained during March/
April and September/October from the South-West quarter, and during September/October,
from the North-East quarter.

2.2 Tools and the procedure
The ordinary post-hole auger is the best sampling tool. Its combined cutting and digging edge
makes it most serviceable for general use even on hard ground. The stem should be marked
at intervals of 15 cm (6 inches) so that the depth of sampling can be ascertained at a glance.
Except in gravely areas, it is possible to sample up to a depth of 60 cm (24 inches) with the
above soil auger, if necessary. As an alternative, the alavangoe normally used for digging
planting holes is satisfactory for the purpose. For collecting soil from depths below the reach of
the soil auger, it is necessary to dig pits. For diagnostic purposes, sampling to a depth of 15cm
(6 inches) would be sufficient. The leaf litter on the soil surface (not incorporated in the soil)

1
should be cleaned before sampling. While collecting soils from the second and lower depths
with an auger, contamination of the samples with the top soil can be minimized by lightly
scraping the outer part of the soil core with a knife.

2.3 Technique of sampling

One of the most important aspects of soil testing is the technique of obtaining a soil sample
that is representative of the area. The errors in sampling a field are generally greater than the
errors in laboratory analysis. The size of the area from which one sample may be taken varies
greatly, but usually ranges from 2 to 10 hectares (5 to 25 acres). A field may be marked into
blocks depending on the area, topography, drainage, past cultural practices, etc. Areas that
vary in appearance, slope, drainage, soil-type should be sampled separately (Figure 1).
Localized areas with extremely poor soil or crop growth should be marked separately and
sampled.

Level land

     

Very steep slope

Figure 1. Demarcation of an area into blocks to obtain representative soil samples of the area
(numbers within the circulars are blocks)

2.4 Number of samples
Using the auger, a large number of core samples should be collected raridomly in a zigzag
manner as shown in Figure 2. It is advisable to take cores from points closer fo the plants
where root activity is high, rather than the middle of the rows. Sampling should not be done
near roads, paths, drains or other non-representative or abnormal areas. The number of soil
cores to be taken would depend on the area which the composite soil sample is expected to
represent. Each sample should contain soil from cores taken at several places in the field.
This procedure is to maximize the influence of uniformity in the soil smaple. From small or
experimental plots, it would suffice to take about 10 cores. When sampling a large field, it
should first be divided into blocks of about 2 hectares (5 acres) and 15 to 20 cores should be
taken from each block.
* The soil cores from each block should’be cotiected on an aluminium/plastic tray or a piece of
polythene sheet or brown paper
* When soil is collected for trace element analyses, the tray should be lined with a polythene
sheet

* The soil should be thoroughly mixed, breaking-up any lumps and spread into a layer

* Small portions from the layers are taken at random and transferred into a clean polythene
bag in order to provide a sub-sample of about /% kilogram (1 Ib)

* The bag should be closed immediately by tying and labelled with a waterproof marking pen,
giving details of location (estate, field and block), depth of sample, date efc. The samples
should then be despatched to the laboratory without undue delay

3. Sample despatch
The samples should be sent directly to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research
Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories located at following addresses
depending on the convenience for transport.
* Soils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory, Walahanduwa, Galle
* Soils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory, Research, Advisory and Extension Centre, PO Box, 130,
Hantana, Kandy

It is necessary that the total cost of analysis should be paid prior to commencing analysis. Payments
could be made through cheques, postal or money orders drawn in favour of “Tea Research Institute
of Sri Lanka” and forward to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of
Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories at Hantana, Kandy and Walahanduwa, Galle.
Money could also be paid at the cash counter of the Tea Research Institute or its centres at the time
of submission of samples for analysis.

ANALYSIS OF FERTILIZER SAMPLES
(This Circular cancels Advisory Circular No. F6, Serial No. 6/92, issued in August 1992)

1. Introduction
The Institute undertakes analysis of fertilizer samples to determine their nutrient contents for ensuring
quality. The values so obtained may differ from those expected of their chemical composition for
the following reasons:
1. Adulteration
2. Presence of excess moisture. Straight fertilizers or fertilizer mixtures which are hygroscopic or
contain hygroscopic components, could absorb moisture and become a slurry, if stored under
humid conditions
. Inadequate mixing of the components of a fertilizer mixture
. Segregation of particles of different sizes in the bag containing the mixture during transport and
storage
. Presence of impurities
. Incorrect sampling procedure
. Analytical errors. This is relatively smail

> &

NOOO

For the results of analysis to be meaningful, it is necessary that great care be taken when sampling
is carried out. It is only then the samples would be representative of the bulk of the fertilizer or
fertilizer-mixture sampled. Thus, it is important that the following procedure be strictly adhered to in
sampling.

2. Sampling
The number of fertilizer bags to be collected at random for sampling should be determined based
on the amount of fertilizer bags in a given store as per Table 1.

Table 1. Guide to determine the number of bags to be sampled

Stock of fertilizer Percentage of the minimum number Number of bags
of bags taken for sampling

Less than 2 bags 100 sample both bags
2-5 bags 60 2
6-10 bags 40 3
11-20 bags 20 3
21-60 bags § 2
61-200 bags 4 3
201-500 bags 3 8
501-1000 bags 2 13
1001 or more bags 1 20

 
The accepted procedure for obtaining a representative sample of fertilizer is described below.

3. Methods of sampling
3.1 Use of a shovel

The bags to be sampled should be selected at random and should be emptied separately on a clean
dry surface and blended using a shovel and one shovelful taken from each. The shovelfuls so
taken should be then thoroughly mixed and any lumps broken up. From this mixture, a sub sample
should be drawn by the process of quartering.

3.2 Use of a sampling probe

1. Use a sampling probe (details given below) to draw samples from fertilizer bags

2. Lay bags horizontally, open one end and pass the probe diagonally from one end to the other
and remove the core

3. From lots of ten bags, take one core from each bag

4. For lots of more than ten bags, select ten bags at random and then take one core from each
bag

5. When it is necessary to sample only lots of less than ten bags, take ten cores but at least one
core from each of the bags

6. For bulk fertilizer, draw at least ten cores from different points

7. From this, subsamples should be drawn by the process of quartering as described below

The sampling probe could be constructed by taking 0.9 m (3 feet) long 5 cm (2 inches) internal
diameter conduit piping or PVC tubing. Cut one end of the tubing obliquely to get a sharp
pointed edge (Figure 1).

4. Subsampling by the process of quartering
~ Itis required to reduce the quantity of fertilizer to a manageable size prior to submission for analysis.
Therefore quartering should be adopted as explained below to subsample the collected fertilizer
(Figure 2).
a. Heap the fertilizer to form a ‘cone’ on a clean sheet of paper or polythene
b. Flatten the cone and divide into two sections through the centre with a metal spatula or wooden
plank
. Divide each half once more and separate the four quarters into four separate piles or quarters
. Reject one set of diagonally opposite quarters and mix the remainder
. Continue the quartering and rejection until the desired quantity of sub sample is obtained
Collect the final remainder as representative sub sample

™~o aod

One kilogram of sub sample is quite sufficient, of which only one-third need be sent for nutrient
analysis, one-third should be sent to the supplier and the balance must be retained by the customer.

Figure 2. Subsampling by quartering

5. Labelling
The samples should be carefully and correctly labelled giving the name of the estate, type of
fertilizer and the date on which the samples was taken. It must be ensured that the label does not
come into contact with the fertilizer sample. This precaution is taken to avoid the labels becoming
illegible at the time of arrival at the TRI laboratories or its centres.

6. Sample despatch
The samples should be sent directly to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research
Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories located at following addresses
depending on convenience for transport.
* Soils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory, Walahanduwa, Galle
* Soils and Plant Nutrition Laboratory, Research, Advisory and Extension Centre, PO Box, 130,
Hantana, Kandy

It is necessary that the total cost of analysis should be paid prior to commencing analysis. Payments
could be made through cheques, postal or money orders drawn in favour of “Tea Research Institute
of Sri Lanka” and forward to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research Institute of
Sri Lanka, Talawakelle or to the regional laboratories at Hantana, Kandy and Walahanduwa, Galle.
Money could also be paid at the cash counter of the Tea Research Institute or its centres at the time
of submission of samples for analysis.

The analysis is being done on the strict understanding that neither the Tea Research Board nor the
Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka will be involved in any litigation, nor will any officers employed
by the above Board or any of its Divisions or its centres be required to answer summons to witness
in any legal action or dispute arising from the results of this or any other analysis of these or similar
samples.

SAMPLING FOR FoLiAR ANALYSIS OF TEA
(This Circular cancels Advisory Circular No. F7 Serial No. 7/92 issued in August 1 992)

1. Introduction
Plant growth is dependent on the nature of the medium in which they grow as well as on other agro-
climatic factors. They extract their nutrient requirements from the soil and for healthy growth, the
important nutrients should be freely available in the right proportions. Either a deficiency or an
excess of any one or more of the nutrients can have a profound influence on the healthy growth of
the plant. A nutrient deficiency or excess will in the first instance, show up in the foliage of the plants
as distinct and characteristic symptoms. Chemical analysis of the foliage of the plants would,
therefore, serve to confirm the visual observations and also give a reasonably good index of their
nutrient status.

If tea growers strictly follow the fertilizer recommendations of the Tea Research Institute of Sri
Lanka, the need for routine analysis would not arise. Foliar analysis is, however, recommended in
instances where growth abnormalities are suspected to be due to nutritional problems.

2. Leaf sampling

For most leaf analysis, it is the first mature leaf (Figure 1) that is collected and it is from the axil of

this leaf that the pluckable shoot emerges. This is usually found on the plucking table, whilst those

below, and consequently shaded should be avoided.

1. When sampling an experimental plot, one or two leaves are taken from each bush in'the plot to
provide a composite sample of about 100 leaves

2. When sampling is carried out on a field scale, a large number of widely distributed bushes
should be sampled, taking one leaf from each bush

3. In order to get a representative sample, it is preferable to randomly select bushes from different
rows

4. Bushes growing in abnormal areas such as close to roads and drains and those in bare patches
should be avoided

5. It is best to avoid collecting leaf samples following a period of prolonged heavy rainfall or during
extreme droughts

3. Sampling and packing procedure of leaf samples

4. Leaf sampling should be avoided in the early part of first year and the latter part of final year of
the pruning cycle. Under low country conditions where certain fields are maintained on a 2 year
cycle, sampling should be done in the 2nd half of first year or 1* half of 2™ year

2. Itis absolutely essential to note that sampling should be done only after a minimum period of 6
weeks following the last ground application of fertilizer

3. From each block of 2 ha, collect about 100 leaves at random selecting only the first mature leaf
at the plucking table (Figure 1)

4. Do not collect more than one leaf per bush

5. Pack the samples in polythene bags

6. Label each sample clearly and ensure that the label is not in contact with the sample. This
precaution is taken to avoid the labels becoming illegible at the time of arrival at the TRI
laboratories or its centres. The labels should contain details of the field and the block number,
seedling or VP tea, year of last prune, length of the pruning cycle and the date of the last
fertilizer application

4. Sample despatch
The samples should be sent directly to the Head, Soils and Plant Nutrition Division, Tea Research

Fertilizer Recommendation for Mature Tea in Small Holdings
This circular replaces Interim Circular No. SP 10, Serial No: 01/10, issued in August 2010.

The soil organic matter content in low and mid country and Uva tea growing regions are generally
low and therefore, the potential of retaining plant nutrients in these soils is also relatively low. This
leads to poor use efficiency of soil applied fertilizers in these regions. Recent assessments done in

small holder lands in these regions revealed that soil magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S) levels are
also significantly low.

Applications of mixed fertilizers containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) as
Urea, Eppawela rock phosphate and Muriate of potash respectively, are recommended for mature
tea fields in 2 to 5 splits per annum. The annual requirement of N is based on the potential yield
categories. Magnesium requirement of the pruning cycle is expected to fulfill by the application of
recommended quantity of dolomite (MgCO3.CaCO3) for pH correction at the time of pruning. The
recommended quantity of dolomite is to be based on soil pH level in the latter part of the last year
of cycle. Dolomite should comply with the specifications given in the TRI Advisory Circular SP3.
Even though dolomite is applied, low nutrient retention capacities of soils may not make Mg
available for plants throughout the pruning cycle. Furthermore, Mg deficiency could also be
induced due to suppression of its uptake by the applications of higher rates of N and K containing

fertilizers. These circumstances invariably lead to lack of Mg in soil and affecting healthy plant
growth.

In view of above observations, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 were formulated
as strategic interventions to improve soil fertility status in the tea small holdings. The suitability of
new mixtures were tested in 26 small holder lands along with the other fertilizer mixtures

previously recommended by the TRI, covering different Agro-ecological regions in major tea
growing areas.

Based on the outcomes of adaptive trials, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 are
recommended for small holdings in all the tea growing regions in addition to previously
recommended fertilizer mixtures for mature VP tea fields in different tea growing regions viz.
VP/LC 880 and VP/LC 1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VP/UM 1020 for mid & up country
and VP/Uva 945 and VP/Uva 1055 for the Uva region (Table 1).

 
 

Growers may select the mixture/s to be used primarily based on the soil nutrient status, yield or
crop responses. It is advisable to use either UT 752 mixture with 100 kg of dolomite per acre per
annum or U 834 mixture if soil Mg and/or S levels are below 60 and 40 milligrams per kilogram
(ppm) respectively in all the tea growing regions. However, if soil Mg level is above 60 ppm and S
level above 40 ppm, it is appropriate to use regional specific mixtures viz. VP/LC 880 and VP/LC
1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VP/UM 1020 for mid and up country and VP/Uva 945 and
VP/Uva 1055 for Uva region.

Considering lower plant density, individual bush manuring is strongly recommended for
the fields yielding less than 130 kg green leaf/ac/month.

Since dolomite is recommended at the rate of 100 kg/ac/yr in one or two applications, as
a source of Mg when UT752 mixture is applied regularly, dolomite should be broadcast at
least four weeks prior to ground fertilizer applications.

In addition to ground fertilizer application, it is essential to apply foliar spray of Zinc
sulphate ideally within 10-14 days after each ground fertilizer application in order to
induce bud break.

The lack of yield or crop response to fertilizer application could be due to many reasons.
Factors such as weather conditions, soil properties and moisture status efc., affect the use
efficiency of applied fertilizer. It is essential to apply fertilizers when the soil is moist.

4
 

Adding organic matter in the form of compost and green manure efc., to tea fields
improves retention of moisture and applied nutrients in soil. In addition, adoption of soil
conservation measures and good agricultural practices (GAPs) significantly improves the
availability of plant nutrients. Hence, application of chemical fertilizers should not be
considered as the only solution for every constraint encountered in tea fields.

INTEGRATED WEED MANAGEMENT IN TEA

(This Advisory Circular supersedes Advisory Circular WM 1 Serial No. 03/13 issued in 2013.
Also this cancels Advisory Circulars WM 2 and WM 3 Serial Nos.10/03 and 11/03, issued in July and
September 2003 respectively)

1. Introduction

Weeds are any plants that grow where they are unwanted or out of place and they interfere with
tea grower’s objectives. There are different types of weed species, in tea fields. The weed species
present in tea lands are summarized in Table 1 based on their morphological classifications.

Table 1: Weed Species present in Tea Lands

 

Broad leaf Ageratum conyzoides (Hulanthala), Asystasia gangetica (Puruk- kola), Bidens
pilosa (Ottu-pillu), Caladium bicolor (Mal Habarala), Commelina diffusa (Gira-
pala), Crassocephalum crepidioides (Thandum- pillu), Erigeron sumatrensis
(Alawungu- pillu), Lantana camara (Ganda-pana), Leucas zeylanica (Geta-
tumba), Miconia crenata (Wal-Bovitiya), Osbeckia octandra (Heen-bowitiya),
Persicaria capitata (Ratu kimbulwenna), Phyllanthus debilis (Ela pitawakka),
Scoparia dulcis (Wal-koththamalli), Sida acuta (Gas-bebila), Solanum
americanum (Kalu kun-  berriya), Spermacoce ocymifolia (Geta-kola),
Sphagneticola trilobata (Arunadevi) etc.

 

Grasses Cenchrus setosus (Nari - naguta), Chrysopogon aciculatus (Thuththiri), Digitaria
abyssinica (Heen Etawara), Eleusine indica (Belathana), Imperata cylindrica
(Illuk), Megathyrsus maximus (Gini-thana), Panicum repens (Etora), Panicum
trichocladum (Kambi-thankola), Setaria barbata (Wal thal kola) etc.

 

 

Sedges Bulbostylis barbata (Uru-Hiri), Cyperus aromaticus, Cyperus brevifolius,
Cyperus mindorensis (Mottu Thana), Cyperus rotundus (Kalanduru), Cyperus
sesquiflorus, Fimbristylis sp. etc.

 

 

 

 

Weeds in tea lands could interfere with the growth of tea by competing for light, space, nutrients
and water, thus affecting the productivity. A dense weed cover could also interfere with routine field
practices such as fertilizer application, plucking, pruning, forking efc., and, could also serve as
alternate hosts for some tea pests and disease organisms.

2. Build-up of Weeds

The abundant occurrence of weeds in tea fields could be attributed to factors such as extensive
areas of exposed soil resulted from poor bush stand, high rainfall, delayed weed control rounds
and surrounding neglected areas serving as weed: seed-banks. The introduction of weed seeds
and vegetative parts with applied compost and mulch, and resorting continuously to a single
herbicide that could lead to resistance development, are other attributes for such development. A
general understanding of the possible causes for weed build-up is important for the tea grower to
select and integrate two or more of the appropriate weed management methods.

{
3. Integrated Weed Management Methods

Weed management in tea lands has to be achieved in an integrated manner. The various practices
adopted include manual, mechanical, chemical, cultural / ecological and biological methods.
Amongst, preventive measures following above methods are very important as their adoption could
help to minimize the cost of weeding.

Integrated Weed Management (IWM), refers to a combination of some or all the above methods, in
a rotational manner throughout the year. IWM utilizes the available know-how on weeds and their
management to achieve cost-effective and eco-friendly weed control (Figure 1).

3.1 Weed Control Calendar

The decision-making process for weed management in tea is based on the weed control calendar
prepared for different regions according to the rainfall pattern, growth stage and bush cover of tea
(Figure 2).

In order to prevent build-up of resistant weed species, maintain the number of herbicide
applications for the year to a minimum (maximum two from a single herbicide), and use a range of
herbicides of different mode of action in rotation than continuing with a single herbicide.

3.2 Special Considerations

In order to arrive at effective weed management method/s, due consideration should be given to .
cost factor, impacts on soil and environment, bush cover and growth stage of tea and the possible
tisk of building up of resistance in weeds etc. Effective weed management also depends on the
accurate identification of weeds (Table 1) and basic understating of their life cycle.

3.3 Preventive Measures

The objective of adopting preventive measures is to minimize accumulation of a seed bank i.e.,
weed seeds and propagules in tea lands. It would in turn assist in lowering the cost of
management of the present and future weed population in tea fields. Appropriate preventive
measures that could be adopted are as follows:

e Undertake weeding when weeds are in tender and before the stage of flowering (mature
stage).

e Keep boundaries of tea fields, roadsides, ravines and other areas adjacent to tea fields free of
weeds to prevent the continuous dispersal of weed seeds into tea fields. Any over-grown
weeds in such areas should be kept slashed or in the alternative to prevent seeding for
keeping them under check.

e Plant cover crops in all exposed areas and utilizing uncultivated areas for thatch banks, or
forestry, to suppress indiscriminate weed growth.

e Adopt a year-round weed management programme using weed management calendar
appropriate to the region for timely attention.

e Use compost and mulching materials in a more rational way, by taking due care not to bring
weed seeds and other vegetative parts such as rhizomes, yams, propagules etc. that are
capable of regeneration into tea fields.

3.4 Cultural / Ecological Weed Control Methods

The objective of adopting cultural / ecological techniques is to enable quick establishment of proper
ground cover of land, to suppress the growth of weeds. This could be achieved by adoption of
following practices;

Infilling vacant patches in tea fields with quick growing, early spreading cultivars that would attain a
quick ground cover and thereby shade out the weeds. In old tea fields, where the vacancies are
not expected to be infilled in near future, a suitable grass such as Mana (Cymbopogon
confertiflorus), Guatemala (Tripsicum laxum), Hybrid napier CO-3 (Pennisetum perpureum X
Pennisetum americarnum) or Vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides) grass may be planted to avoid
such vacant patches becoming breeding grounds for weeds. These grasses will suppress weeds
due to their smothering and allelopathic effects.

Planting of green manure crops, such as Crotalaria micans (Adanahiriya), Tithonia diversifolia (wild
sun flower), Wild chrysanthemum / Mari Kolondu (Artemisa vulgaris) or Flemingia macrophylla in
vacant patches and as a hedge row for thatching in tea fields is also useful. Cover crops such as
Mal ratakaju (Arachis pintoi) could also be planted on two feet wide strips in middle of the tea inter
rows and Eth undupiyalaiya (Grona ovalifolia) and Indigofera sp. in non-tea areas such as
roadsides, boarders, abandoned lands etc.

Using suitable (i) mulching materials such as Mana, Guatemala, Godapara (Dillenia suffruticosa),
Flemingia macrophylla etc. (ii) artificial agriculture mulch could be used to cover the inter-row
spaces as effective mulching sources.

Adoption of all possible measures to encourage the early development of frames in the tea bush
and maintaining bush stand is essential in minimizing the potentials of weed emergence. This
could be achieved using healthy and well spreading nursery plants in new clearings, proper infilling
programs, adoption of Good Agricultural Practices ensuring implementation of timely bringing-into-
bearing to enhance spread of peripheral branches of the bush.

 
3.5 Manual Weeding

Manual weeding could be undertaken either by exclusively “hand-pulling” weeds or by “slash
weeding”, as described below:

Hand pulling is the removal of weeds totally by hand. Although a costly operation, it is a safer
method than chemical weeding.

Clean weeding by using a scraper should be strongly discouraged. Selective weeding should be
advocated, where shallow rooted soft herbs such as Centella asiatica (Gotukola), Drymaria cordata
(Kadalai kodi), Grona triflora, (Heen undupiyaliya), Euphorbia scordiifolia (Heendada keeriya),
Oxalis sp. (Ambul ambiliya), Stemodia verticillata, Mollugo pentaphylla etc. which are beneficial are
retained to serve as a live ground cover.

Digging the soil to remove tuberous or rhizomatous weeds is not advocated because such practice
could aggravate weed infestation arising through regrowth of fragmented underground plant parts
that are capable of regeneration.

Weeds that are resistant to herbicides should be hand pulled, along with other free-growing weeds.

All creeping weeds such as Anredera cordifolia (Passali kodi), Camonea pilosa (Maha-Madu/Kiri-
madu-vael), /pomoea sp. (Railway glory/ Morning glory), Mikania sp. (Watupalu/Lokapalu),
Neustanthus phaseoloides (Pohora- wel), Xenostegia tridentata (Heen madu wel) efc. should be
removed manually.

All the weeds that are removed from a tea field should be piled up in a wooden cage within the tea
block. It is necessary to mix up the heap once in a while, to check and remove re-growing
tuberous, rhizomatous weeds. Weeds should be used for composting only after picking out the
yams, bulbils and other vegetative parts capable of regeneration, and destroying them.

3.6 Mechanical Weeding

Slash weeding is the removal of weeds by cutting them at the base with a hoe/cutter in mechanical
weeder. Woody, grass and deep-rooted perennial weeds, that resist removal by hand or herbicide,
should be slashed. Continual slashing will result in a gradual decline in weed seed population in
the soil.

Mechanical Weeding using grass cutters (with a proper guard) is more suitable for tea lands with
large vacant patches.

It should be noted that recovery of weeds is faster with continual use of slashing.

3.7 Chemical Weed Control

Chemical weed control among other various weed management techniques available under IWM is
economically important in tea. Selection of herbicides should be based on the type of weed
species, growth stage of tea, growth cycle of weeds and the weed control calendar introduced to
respective regions. Precautionary measures should be adopted in the use of herbicides to avoid
any non-target effects to the crop, humans and the environment.

Please refer to Advisory Circular PU 3 for details of different herbicides recommended for tea,
modes of action, dosages and precautionary measures.
3.8 Biological Weed Control

Biological weed control is defined as an activity aimed at decreasing the weed species population
to an acceptable level through the use of a living organism. In tea fields, there are only a few
 

competitive plant species that can control another weed species by competing with it for one or
more growth factors (water, nutrients and light). Biological control in tea could be termed more
appropriately as ecological control. Control of African couch (Digitaria abyssinica) by planting
Brachiaria brizantha is one such example in tea lands.

GUIDELINES ON THE USE OF ""SOIL QUALITY INDEX"" (SQI) FOR 
DECISION MAKING IN SOIL REHABILITATION PRIOR TO 
REPLANTING  
 
Introduction  
Soil rehabilitation by planting recommended grasses; Guatemala ( Tripsacum laxum ) 
or Mana ( Cymbopogon confertiflorus)  and maintaining for a minimum of 18 months, 
prior to replanting is a recommended practice in tea cultivat ion. Long term 
experimental evidence reveals replanting, with soil rehabilitation is economically 
viable  and replanting without rehabilitation would lead to productivity decline in most 
tea lands including the smallholdings. However, there has been a concern in the 
smallholdings sector as to the long gestation of  18–24 months for  soil rehabilitation. It 
has also been evident that some arable lands are sufficiently fertile so that they could 
be replanted without soil rehabilitation. The above circumstances together with 
unavailability of adequate extent of lands amongst small holders for replanting, has 
prompt ed the Tea Research Institute to carry out investigations to  introduce 
alternative approaches for decision making in soil rehabilitation prior to replanting.   
   
Soil Quality Index  
Development, validation and u se of Soil Quality Indices (SQIs) in the promotion of 
sustainable agriculture has  been considered as a novel strategy. The soil quality is 
defined as the soil’s capacity to perform within managed ecosystem boundaries to 
sustain plant productivity while red ucing soil degradation. A range of soil parameters 
or indicators has been identified to estimate soil quality, depending on crop, adoption 
of agricultural practices and crop interactions with environments. As to local tea 
cultivation, soil bulk density (BD ; gram per cm3), available water content (AWC; mm 
per 30  cm), organic carbon (C; %) and microbial biomass content (MBC µg per gram 
of soil) from a depth of 0 -30 cm, have been used to compute the soil quality indices 
for different tea growing regions. The s cores given to averages of each of the above 
parameters and their variations in the Index are given in Table 1. Each parameter was 
provisionally assigned with weighted average and they were later validated from the 
actual data and their relationships.

The formulae used for the computation of SQI  for different tea growing regions is as 
follows:  
 
 
SQIs for different tea growing regions  
Accordingly, recommended SQIs for tea  lands  in different tea growing regions have 
been established, considering the aforesaid parameters of the rehabilitated fields  and 
neighboring fields earmarked for up -rooting , as given in Table 2.  
 
Table 2: Recommended SQI value for different regions  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Methodology for the d etermination of SQI of lands earmarked for tea replanting  
 
Submission of expression of interest  
Requests  for the determination of SQI should  be sent to the Director of  Tea Research 
Institute of Sri Lanka, Talawakelle, by the Regional Manager, Tea Small Holdings 
Development Authority .  
 
Compliance to land suitability  criterion  
It is essential that the lands earmarked for replanting should qualify for tea cultivation 
as per the TRI Guidelines on Land Suitability Classification for Tea (Refer TRI 
Advisory Circular LU 1; Serial No. 03/02, Issued in October 2002) , or TSHDA 
Guidelines .

Mid country  6 
Up country  7 
Uva 7 SQI = 0.36 BD + 0.14 AWC + 0.34 C + 0.16 MBC  Page 3 of 3 
 Compliance for absence  of nematodes, root diseases and up  country live wood 
termite  
The l and selected for replanting based on land suitability criteria, referred to above is 
then checked for the occurrence of parasitic nematodes, root diseases viz. Poria and 
white root disease  and up  country live wood termite , based on historical information 
in the relevant region /location  and/or analytical results . Also, e armarked field need s to 
be checked for presence of nematode species  as per the TRI Advisory Circular PM  5; 
Serial  No. 0 3/10, Issued in December 2010.  Once the land is  cleared as free from the 
incidences of the above pest s and diseases  and any other irreversible  factors hindering 
the healthier tea cultivation, Soil Quality Index (SQI) for the land will be then 
computed.  
 
Sampling procedure  
In order to determine the SQI  of the earmarked field,  it is necessary to c ollect soil 
samples at least from six points  (core samples) per one acre plot ( 15 samples per ha) , 
identified randomly representing the land. For this purpose, the  field may be separated 
into few blocks depending on the topography and drainage etc. and sampled them 
separately  if required . The n umber of samples may vary proportionately depending on 
the actual extent earmarked for  replanting  and/or blocks , with a minimum of two 
samples . Also, it is necessary to take soil samples  avoiding drains, field paths, ravines 
and unusual patches. Undisturbed core s amples for BD and AWC are taken from       
0-10, 10 -20 and 20 -30 cm depths whereas for C and MBC , samples  are taken  at 0-15 
and 15 -30 cm  depths separately, from each sampling p oint.  
 
Once soil samples  are collected, they should be individually labelled, packed and 
handed over to the Tea Research Institute immediately for soil analyses  and 
computation of the SQI.    
 
Recommendation  
Once the SQI value is computed as per the above formulae, and if the value is equal 
or more than  the recommended  value for the region (Table 2), it is in order  to plant tea 
directly following other recommended agricultural practices. However, if the 
computed SQ I value is less than the recommended , it is absolutely necessary to 
undertake soil  rehabilitat ion by planting recommended grass  species  for a minimum 
period of 18 months, prior to replanting of tea.

GUIDELINES ON THE USE OF CO -3 GRASS (HYBRID NAPIER) FOR SOIL 
REHABILITATION BEFORE REPLANTING OF TEA  
IN THE LOW COUNTRY  
 
Introduction  
Soil rehabilitation for a period o f 18-24 months  before replanting of old tea , is a must 
to improve soil  conditions , minimize weed,  pest and disease infestations  and reduce 
soil toxicity .  Most of the farmers are reluctant to grow rehabilitation grass es for such 
a long period  before tea cu ltivation since there is no income generat ed during this 
period. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of planting materials of recommended 
rehabilitation grass species such as Mana and Guatemala, particularly in the low 
country tea growing region. Therefore , it has become necessary  to identify alternative 
grass  species to reduce the length of soil rehabilitation period.  The Hybrid  Napier  
grass (Pennisetum purpureum x Pennisetum americanum ), Variety CO -3 with 
following beneficial characteristics has been proven to be a  suitable alternative to 
Mana and Guatemala . 
 
Characteristics of CO-3 Grass  
 This is one of the inter-specific  Hybrid Napier varie ties used for fodder 
production. The hybridization occur s naturally between two species such as  
Common Napier  (Pennisetu m purpureum ) and Pearl millet  (Pen nisetum 
americanum) . These  two species readily cross and that the resultant inter  
specific hybrids are more vigorous than the parent species and highly sterile. 
Therefore , it can be used as fo dder without danger of becomin g a weed . 
 
 It has a  well ecological adaptability to the low country climatic condition s and 
a high grow th rate. 
 
 It improves soil chemical, p hysical and biological properties.  
 
 It has more  leafy growth and  show s high coppicing ability. Hence, appreciable  
number of loppings could be obtained within a short period of time.  
 
 Hybrid Napier variety has a higher tillering ability than Mana  (Cymbopogon 
confertiflorus)  or Guatemala  (Tripsacum laxum)  grass species . 
 Page 2 of 3 
  It gives h igher shoot and root biomass production than Mana and Guatemala  
(Table 1 and 2). As a result,  it add s highe r quantity of organic matter into the 
sub soil  at the end of rehabilitation  period.   
 
 The weed management cost during  rehabilitation period could  also be reduced 
due to rapid growth habit  of the grass , covering the land within a very short 
period of time

Climatic and s oil requirements  for CO-3 grass    
The CO-3 grass grows well in high rainfall are as (in excess of 1500 mm per year)  and 
under full sunlight. The o ptimum temperature range for its growth is 25 – 40oC. The 
CO-3 grass  is very susceptible to frost.  Hence, it is not suitable for tea growing 
regions at high elevation s especially above 1500  m amsl . Water logg ing and very 
acidic soil conditions are also not conducive for growth of CO -3 grass . 
 
Planting of CO -3 Grass  
 After uprooting old tea, prepare and  level the land for planting of grasses. 
Dolomite should be applied at the recommended rate t o improve soil pH to the 
desirable range  (Please refer TRI Advisory Circular No. SP 6 on Fertilizer 
Recommendations For Rehabilitation Grasses, I ssued in July 2000) . 
 
 Fresh cuttings with 3 -4 nodes  soon after removal  from the mother plants are 
recommended  for planting as s ufficient amount s of food and water reserve s 
should be present  for successful sprou ting of buds and initial growth.  
 
 The grass cuttings should be planted at  the beginning of rainy season at a spacing 
of 0.3  m x 0.6 m; Approximately  55,500 stem-cutting s are required  for one 
hectare . 
 Page 3 of 3 
  Cuttings should be pla nted in holes made with a pointed stick or ‘Alavangu’ at an 
angle of 45  degrees  from the ground leaving  at least 2 nodes above the ground  and 
the soil around the cutting should be compacted w ell without leaving any air 
pockets. 
 
Fertilizer  application  
The grass should be regularly fertilized  using  the fertilizer mixture U  625 (Please refer TRI 
Advisory Circular No. SP 6 on Fertilizer Recommendations For Rehabilitation Grasses, 
Issued in July 2 000) similar to  other rehabilitation grasses . The quantities and times of 
fertilizer application s are 160, 210, and 310 kg per ha at the time of sprouting new shoots, 
after the 1st lopping, and after the 2nd and 3rd lopping respectively.   
 
Management  practices 
It takes about 4 -8 weeks  to form a good ground cover.  The grass should be lopped at 
regular intervals and the loppings should be spread on the ground between the contour 
rows. The first lopping  can be done  at a height of 45  – 60 cm from ground about 3 
months  after planting  and the  subsequent loppings could be done around 75 - 90 cm 
above the ground. The l opping should be done before the grass flowers and 4 loppings 
per year  are possible . It needs to be protected from the animals as it is a fodder grass . 
At the  end of the one-year rehabilitation period, g rass should be cut at the ground 
level and the stem parts should be removed from the field to prevent re -growth .

GUIDELINE FOR CLEFT GRAFTING IN TEA  NURSERIES  
 
Introduction  
Grafting is the technique of combining  plant parts or plants together with desirable 
characters so that they will unite and grow as a single unit .  This is a standard 
horticultural practice, which involves the combination of two plants of different 
genetic constitution , having different characters. In tea cultivation , it is advantageous 
to have a combination of s ome of desirable characters such as high yield, quality, 
drought tolerance and pest and disease  tolerance which could be obtained by grafting. 
Success of graft ing depend s on the  compatibility  of cultivars  and skills of workers . 
  
Technique of cleft graftin g tea     
Cleft grafting involve s two components of plant parts which are referred as scion and 
stock. Cutting s for grafting are obtained from the same type of shoots as employed for 
vegetative propagation of tea. Shoots for taking cuttings to be used as sc ion and stock 
should be  obtained after proper pruning of mother bushes . Cuttings should be kept in 
water and grafting  should be carried out in a shaded place . Other nursery practices are 
same as that of the conventional  nurseries (Please refer TRI Advisory  Circular No. 
PN2 on Tea Nursery Management, I ssued in November 2009) .  
 
Scion: This is the upper component of the graft . Desirable characters for the scion are 
high yield , quality and  pest and disease  tolerance (e.g. Blister Blight ). It is a single 
node c utting where the basal 1.5 cm  of stem is shaved off on two sides to form a 
wedge  (Fig. 1).  
 
                         
  
 
 
Stock: The stock or basal part of the graft is also a single node cutting , but h ere the 
stem  above the node of the stock should extend up to about 2.5 cm. A cleft of about Fig. 1. Preparation of scion  1.5 cm wedge  2.0 cm stem  Page 2 of 4 
 1.5 cm deep is made  by splitting the stem  above the node using a budding knife . The 
cleft should not be too deep and should correspond to the length of the wedge in the 
scion  (Fig. 2). The desirable characters for th e stock are better rooting, drought 
tolerance , and pest and disease tolerance abilities viz. parasitic Nematodes.  
 
                                                     
  
 
Union of scion and stock : Wedge is insert ed into the cleft until it is firmly held 
without exposing the cut so that the leaves of stock and scion will be on opposite sides  
(Fig. 3). The g raft union is then gently tied using a strip of long polythene  
commencing  from the bottom upwards  or clipped (grafting clips) to prevent water 
travellin g in (Fig. 4).

Planting of the grafted cutting s: Grafted cutting  is planted in soil filled nursery bags 
up to the  petiole of  mother leaf of stock , ensur ing its axillary bud  is not covered with 
soil. After planting , the soil ar ound the cutting should be gently pressed to avoid air 
pockets . Then watering should be done thoroughly to saturate soil in the nursery bags 
and the bed . The nursery bed should be covered using a 300-gauge  transparent 
polythene sheet laid over s emi circula r hoops of about  90 cm ( 3 feet ) height from the 
ground . It should be sealed on all sides for maintaining high humidity . High shade 
should be provided as for the conventional nurseries at 180 cm ( 6 feet ) height. If the 
moisture inside the propagator is  found inadequate, the polythene may be opened for 
watering again and sealed  immediately . After 2 - 3 months period , propagator can be 
opened gradually , over 4  - 5 days . Polythene strip or grafting clip should be removed 
one month after opening the propagator . The other nursery after care operations  such 
as watering, fertilizer application , re-stackin g, hardening of plants, encouraging early 
spread  (disbudding and thumb  nailing ) and pest and disease control  etc. are 
undertaken as in the case of an ordinary nurse ry. While the axillary bud of the scion is 
allowed to grow , the shoot arising from the stock should be removed only after 5 
months from planting of cutting.  
 
Planting in the field:  A well grown grafted plants could be trans planted in the field 
after a nursery period of 8 - 10 and 10 - 12 months in the low and up country growing 
conditions  respectively . 
 
Compatible graft combinations  
As all the cultivars are not compatible with one another, large number of 
combinations have  been tried out  by the TRI  before  making  firm recommendations . 
Based on nursery and field performances, f ollowing graft combinations are 
recommended as compatible combinations .

GUIDELINES FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF ENERGY PLANTATIONS WITH  
 GLIRICIDIA SEPIUM AND CALLIANDRA CALO THRYSUS  
 
Introduction   
Tea processing requires a large quantity of fue lwood . Usually, it is estimated that 1 -
1.5 kg of fuelwood is required to  process 1  kg of made tea. Additionally, plantation 
workers also need  fuelwood for their domestic use.  Often, the total demand of 
fuelwood cannot be met within the plantation . In addition t o use of fuelwood for tea 
processing, it can be used as an energy source for generating electricity (Dendro 
power). As a result , there is a growing demand for fuelwood in Sri Lanka.  In order to 
ensure regular and assured supply of fuelwood for industry req uirement, marginal tea 
fields  (low yielding)  and those abandoned owing to land suitability limitations (poor 
soil conditions, rocky lands, excessive slopes , etc.) and scarcity of labour , can be 
converted to fuelwood plantation s with Gliricidia sepium  and Calliandra calothrysus . 
Calorific value of both the above trees varies from 4,500 - 4,900 kcal per kg. While 
Gliricidia can be successfully established in the low , mid and Uva region s (up to 900 
m elevation) , Calliandra is most suitable for mid and up count ry regions  within the  
elevation rang e 300 - 1300 m.  
 
In addition to the use of woody part as fuelwood, the leaves and top most part s of the  
branches can be applied to tea fields as a green manure and mulch , adding nutrients to 
the soil  and to conserv e soil moisture . In addition to this, these leaves can also be 
easily used for producing compost.  Nitrogen fixation ability of these leguminous trees 
helps to improve soil fertility.  Further, these two species are well adapted to varying 
soil and climatic condit ions, require less intensive agronomic input s and labour , and 
withstand regular lopping . 
 
Based on the field observations  done by TRI at different locations , the following 
agronomic practices need to be adopted when  Gliricidia  and Calliandra  are used for 
establishment of f uelwood  or energy plantation s.  
 
 Land should be prepared by levelling adequately  to locate rows of energy crops  
and all soil conservation measures i.e. preparation of drains and stone terraces 
etc. should be adopted as necessary . 
 
 The idea l spacing for planting of Gliricidia  and Calliandra  as fuelwood is 1 m x 
1 m,  having a plant density of about 10,000 plants per hectare . Adequate 
amount of healthy planting materials ( stumps or nursery plants) should be kept 
ready accordingly.  Page 2 of 3 
 Establishme nt of  Gliricidia  
 The diameter and depth of hole should  be 30  cm and 45 - 60 cm  respectively . 
 
 While filling hole , soil should be mixed with dolomite at the rate of 200  – 225 g 
per hole. It is  preferable to add 1 kg of compost per planting hole . 
 
 Select 6  - 8 mon ths old mature stumps of about 1.5 m in length and 5  - 7.5 cm in 
girth . 
 
 When planting 30 - 40 cm of the b asal end of the stump should be buried in soil . 
 
 To prevent desiccation and encourage bud break, the stump can be white -
washed using 20%  hydrate d lime . Top end of the pole should be covered with a 
ball of mud or piece of polythene.  
 
 Stumps should ideally be planted during wet weather within 48 hrs from  
lopping . 
 
 Care should be taken not to damage the bark of the planting end . For this 
purpose , the stump  can be inserted into an alavango hole prepared before.  
 
Establishment of Calliandra  
 Calliandra can be established directly by sawing 3  - 4 seeds per planting hole 
and leaving one vigorous plant while removing other seedlings . 
 
 Alternatively,  plants can be  raised in poly bags in the nurser y and 4  - 6 month 
old plants can be established in the field . 
 
Lopping and aftercare  
 First lopping of branches can be done about 12  - 18 months after planting .  
 
 Branches can be l opped at 8 - 12 month interval s befor e flow ering . 
 
 In order to produce a well spread frame with sturdy branches , the other branches 
should be cut keeping a stump of about 30 cm ( 1 feet) above the previous cut . 
 
 Soft and leafy portion of the branches should be removed and fuelwood can be 
cut to a le ngth of a bout 1 m for easy storage  and use .   
 
 Moisture content of the fuelwood should be reduced to 20% or below, by 
staking them under rain cover for about  2 weeks  before use . 
 Page 3 of 3 
  A well-managed  Gliricidia  plantation produces  about 25 - 30 tons  of fue lwood 
per hectare per year and Calliandra  produce  about  10 - 15 tons per hectare per 
year in dry weight  basis  (20% moisture).  
 
 Cost benefit analys is have shown that management of energy plantations with 
Gliricidia  and Calliandra  is an economically viable v enture  and the pay -back 
period varies from 5 - 6 years .  
 
Therefore , tea growers , stakeholders  and entrepreneurs are encouraged to establish  
fuelwood  or en ergy plantations , converting  marginal  and un -productive lands into 
economic use  to ensure  assured fuelwood supply . It will assist to conserv e 
environment and bio -diversity .

GUIDELINE  ON IRRIGATION OF TEA FIELDS  
 
Introduction  
Tea is cultivated predominantly as a rain -fed plantation crop . Lack of water bodies , 
geographical limitations and ina bility to use conventional irrigation techniques such 
as flood and furrow irrigation have hindered the application of irrigation in tea 
plantations. Introduction of micro irrigation techniques  viz. drip and sprinkler 
irrigation, frequent drought occurrence s and productivity  improvements etc. have 
prompted stakeholders to seek alternative techniques to manage soil moisture levels. 
Also, high impact droughts, impacts of climate change and poor replanting rate s have  
created renewed interest s in adopting suitab le irrigation  techniques . It is evident that 
rudimentary to modern irrigation techniques have been practiced in tea fields alt hough 
adoption of such techniques is not feasible  in the  entire plantation . However, t here are  
tea fields, where irrigation c ould be applied with the development of in-situ water 
bodies . Since management of soil moisture levels plays a pivotal role in sustainable 
crop production , it is necessary to advise stakeholders to take correct decisions on 
adoption of suitable irrigation  techn iques . This guideline serves as a basis for decision 
making on irrigation as a potential drought mitigation strategy in tea plantation.  
 
Selection of irrigation as an option for drought  mitigation  
There are many other drought mitigation techniques recommen ded by the TRI (Please 
refer Advisory Circular No . PA 2 on Drought Mitigation in Tea Plantations, Issued in 
January 2011). However, unlike those strategies, irrigation involves critical technical 
inputs and financial commitments. Therefore, decision making  should be 
economically viable. Hence, it is necessary to carefully analyze the drought effects in 
a particular location or estate and decide whether such damage can be prevented by 
other less costly drought mitigation techniques.  
 
Fields to be irrigated  
1. Newly planted tea fields are more vulnerable to drought, as their root system has 
not fully developed. Returns in investments for irrigation would be higher in the 
long term when new cl earings (immature fields) are  irrigated.  
 
2. Low elevation tea plantations  are more vulnerable to drought because of high 
ambient temperature during dry periods.  
 
3. Within estates too, there could be fields, frequently subjected to drought damage 
due to the geographic location, poor soil and presence of drought susceptible 
cultivar s. High yielding cultivars usually gives higher returns to irrigation.  Page 2 of 3 
 4. Irrigation of tea fields earmarked for pruning is usually not economical, unless 
they are threatened with death  of plant s due to drought.  
 
Requirements for irrigation  
Before making the final decision on irrigation, following factors need to be carefully  
considered.  
 
1. Availability of water source:  Availability of a permanent and a reliable water 
source is essential for successful irrigation during the drought. In view of this , 
potential ma ximum duration of drought according to the estate location needs to 
be found. Many water sources in tea estates are dry during severe drought periods.  
It is also necessary to ascertain whether the use of water source for irrigatio n 
affects estate community  and down streams users  to avoid potential social 
conflicts . 
 
2. If such a reliable water source is not available, it should either be develop ed (e.g. 
Irrigation well) or water should be transport ed from the  bowsers, as and when 
necessary. However, it should be remembered that transportation would increase 
operational cost depending on the distance to the water source.  
 
3. Selection of irrigation system depends on the level of investment, type of water 
source and technical expertise available to maintain the syst em etc., 
 
Selection of i rrigation method/s ystem  
Irrigation can be done manually or by using permanent or portable irrigation system. 
The permanent irrigation system can be either drip or sprinkler irrigation.  
 
Manual i rrigation  
Manual watering is the most popular irrigation method in tea plantations , where water 
is applied to plants by workers manually . Normally, water is transported by a bowser 
or rarely using a nearby water source. Advantage of this method is that there is no 
investment cost for an irriga tion system. H owever, operational cost would be high as 
workers have to be employed for irrigation. The chances for under irrigation that 
could result in a poor response, is also one of the main disadvantage s. 
 
Drip i rrigation  
Drip irrigation is the applic ation of irrigation water through emitters  fixed to an 
irrigation tube. The most economical drip irriga tion system for tea is the in -line drip 
tubes. It is the most efficient irrigation water application system which ensures 
uniform water application throu ghout the field. Pressure requirements to operate a 
drip system are  low. Also,  application of irrigation water through drips prevent, 
unnecessary wetting of plant stems.  
 Page 3 of 3 
 However, drip system usually requires higher investment cost than sprinkler system. 
Also, water quality should be at a higher level to prevent possible blocking of 
drippers. Certain technical knowledge is necessary for operating a drip system and 
intervention of irrigation specialist may be required for trouble free operation.  
 
Sprinkler i rrigation  
Sprinkler irrigation can be done by a permanent set of sprinklers or a mobile sprinkler 
head. Alternatively, gun -type mobile sprinkler heads, capable of covering a radius 
usually more than 15  m, c ould also be used. Investment cost for such gun -type 
sprinkler is lower. However, additional man power is necessary to operate such 
systems in the field.   
 
The operation and maintenance of the system is user friendly.  Also, it gives a cooling 
effect to the plant micro environment, which is important dur ing drought periods. In 
addition to drought mitigation, sprinklers can be used to minimize frost damage in tea 
at high elevation. Some disadvantages of the sprinkler irrigation system are high 
energy use, low application efficiency and potential theft and vand alism of the 
permanent irrigation equipment.  
 
Economics of irrigation  
Return on investment for irrigation depends mainly on investment/operational cost 
and plant response to irrigation (yield increment and plant survival). The investment 
and operationa l cost vary according to the irrigation system. Estimation of system cost 
needs to be obtained through a service provider or vendor. Based on the potential 
drought damage, return on investment for irrigation could also be worked out. In 
general, investment  cost for drip irrigation system for a unit area is higher than the 
permanent sprinkler irrigation systems. However, water application efficiency for drip 
irrigation system is higher than that of sprinkler irrigation systems. Hence drip 
irrigation system i s best suited for water limited locations.  Mobile gun -type sprinkler 
irrigator could be used as a low investment strategy depending on the exigencies of 
the situation.

anthropogenic emissions of Green House Gases (GHG) such as CO 2, CH 4, N 2O, O 3, 
CFCs to the atmosphere  is reportedly posing a threat to tea production. The t ea 
industry in Sri Lanka sustains livelihood of a significant portion of the population  in 
the country  and brings in much needed foreign exchange . Sustainability of the 
industry is vital not only because of its socio -economic importance, but to address 
environmental concerns as we ll. It is primarily because  majority of tea lands are on 
steep terrains and in watershed feeding areas to the  river system s of the country that 
are highly vulnerable to soil degradation in the event of bush debilitation, death of 
bushes and abandonment of tea lands owing to low productivity.   
 
Impacts of climate change  
The rising CO 2 levels, ambient temperatures and variation of rainfall are likely to 
affect carbohydrate assimilation, chemical attributes of tea leaf, pest and disease 
infestation, soil quali ty, evapotranspiration  and rainfall pattern influencing land 
productivity and quality of tea. Studies carried out at the Tea Research Institute of Sri 
Lanka have shown that most of the tea growing areas in low country, mid country and 
Uva are either highly vulnerable or vulnerable to climate change  impacts while those 
in up country  are relatively less vulnerable . Therefore, it is imperative that appropriate 
adaptation measures be implemented to minimize  adverse impacts of climate change 
on the tea sector.   
 
Adaptation strategies  
Moisture stress, excessive soil moisture /flood  (extreme rainfall), heat stress, high 
intensity of weed, pest and disease infestations and soil degradation (soil erosion, loss 
of organic matter , etc.) are the key issues i nfluencing tea land productivity  under 
climate change . Therefore, the following  adaptation strategies  have been identified  
addressing those key issues and their impacts on growth and tea yield. In addition , 
raising awareness of tea growing communities on climate change and its impacts is 
imperative to successfully face various unforeseen challenges connected to climate 
change.  
 
Attention should also be paid for seasonal weather forecasting and meteorological 
disaster predication s issued by relevant organizations  and landslide prone 
areas/locations to prevent/minimize weather related disasters.

  Planting of tea cultivars, improved seedlings and grafted plants well-adapted  
to adversities of weather (drought, water logging, warm climatic  conditions , 
etc.) and tolerant to various pest and diseases.  
 Establishment and management of shade trees and shelter belts to modify 
micro -climate  around tea bushes . 
 Soil and soil moisture conservation and rain water harvesting  (contour and 
leader drains, stone terrac es, SALT hedgerows, mulching, burying of pruning , 
etc.) 
 Improvement of soil organic matter content in tea lands  (shade trees, cover 
crops, mulching compost  and bio-char application , soil conservation, etc.)  
 Integrated pest and disease management  
 Improvem ent of soil aeration and drainage to remove excess moisture from the 
root zone  
 Irrigation during dry spells  
 Judicious use of fertilizers to minimize loss  of nutrients (e .g. nitrogen)  due to 
high temperature and extreme weather conditions  (slow release fertilizers, 
timing and frequency of application , etc.)   
 Selection of lands with suitable growing conditions (soil and environmental) 
for replanting/new planting  of tea  
 Crop diversification to reduce risk of mono -cropping  especially where s oil 
conditions a re marginal for tea cultivation   
 Diversification of  income through other avenues (e .g. Ecotourism, livestock 
farming, bee -keeping , etc.) to compe nsate impending losses from tea  
 Afforestation, reforestation and establishment of energy/timber plantations and 
watershed in tea plantations

GUIDELINES FOR USE OF MOTORIZED TEA PRUNING MACHINES  
 
Introduction  
With continuous harvesting of shoots over several years, the tea bush rises beyond the 
comfortable reach of pluckers ’ hand and it also tends to produce fewer  shoots , more 
dormant shoots ( banjies ) and more flower buds. Furthermore , a close canopy may 
accumulate  debili tated branches and dead woods.  Therefore, it becomes necessary to 
prune tea bushes at regular intervals for reducing the height , stimul ating  vegetative growth 
and maintain ing the health of te a bush. The  ultimate objective of pruning is the  effective 
utilization of the land area under tea.  Depending on the bush health (vigour), 
environmental conditions (elevation) and type of tea (seedling or VP) , the pruning cycle 
varies from  around 2 - 5 years .  
 
Tea bushes are best pruned manually as it paves the way for individual removal of 
branches. However, it requires a large number of skilled workers (40 -50 workers/ha). 
Further more , pruning needs to be completed  within a certain period of the year  i.e. within  
a few months of the rainy season  avoiding dry weather. With the scarcity of workers , there 
is a great tendency in the tea plantations to use motorized machines for pruning tea.    
 
Tea pruning  machines   
Tea pruning machines are usually brush (bush) cutters  carried on  shoulder s. They often  
have a 2 stroke engine and 1-1.3 m long guide tube with a drive shaft to which a 
pruning blade is mounted (see Figure  1). The blade rotates anti -clock -wise. A wide 
handle  fixed to the drive tube has engine controls such as the throttle.  The weight of the 
machine is generally 6 -8 kg. The output of the pruning machines varies from  150-250 
bushes  per hour  depending  on the size of the bush frame , conditions  of the field  and 
operator’s skill . The fuel consumption of pruning machines is about 0.75 -1 liter per 
hour.

 Proper use of pruning machine s in the field   
 Workers should be properly trained for operating and day-to-day maintenance  of 
the machine  and educat ed on  safety aspects periodically as per manufacturer's 
instructions.   
 The require d quantity  of gasoline (petrol) and 2T oil mixture should be prepared 
daily for the two-stroke engine as per manufacturer’s recommendations . A freshly 
prepared and well-mixed (shacked)  fuel mixture should be used for filling the fuel 
tank.  
 Operators should use safety gears such as jungle boots and goggles.  
 Pruning machines should not be used for formative  pruning  (first proper pruning) 
of tea bushes as such tea bushes  do not have well -developed frame and root system.  
 It is essential to rest (withhold harvesting) tea fields for a minimum period of  6 
weeks  prior to  pruning.  
 Over grown weed cover in tea fields reduce s the output of pruning machine s and 
hence, should adequately  be cleaned before pruning.  
 As the blade rotates anti -clock -wise, it should be fixed to the gear head correctly so 
that the cutting edges of the blade face towards the rotating direction (see Figure 2  
& operator’s manual /instructions  for details).   
 The smoothness of the cut depends on the number of tips, sharpness and speed 
(rpm) of the blade. Therefore, blades with tungsten carbide tips (around  100) are 
ideal for tea pruning. Engine should be throttled adequately before the cut is made.  
 The cut should be preferably made by using one-third of the blade (circumference) 
from the front to the left ( see Figure 2 ). Blade with broken or blunt tips should not 
be used for  pruning.  
 Few branches near est to  the operator should be cut first at the recommended height 
and the balance should be removed  progressively (step wise)  at the same height by 
swinging the pruner (from the right to  left) while  moving  forward . 
 Branches should be cut by exerting a mild pressure  to the blade . The blade  should 
never  be dashed towards the frame of the tea bush  as it damage s the blade and the 
branches .  
 It is dangerous to try and remove branches/twigs or other matter  entangled with the 
blade if any, while the engine is running.   
 One or two healthy and peripheral branches  having 200 -300 leaves  on the left -side 
of the bush should  be left as lungs. 
 Branches should be removed so that the top surface of the bush frame fol lows the 
slope of the land.  
 Manual cleaning of the frames by removing knots, damaged, dead, diseased and 
pest attacked branches  is essential after the machine pruning to preserve the  bush  
health.  
 The remnant fuel if any should be removed from the tank and those in the 
carburetor should  also be burnt by running the engine for few minutes until it 
automatically stops at the end of the day.  Page 3 of 3 
  Blade and the engine including air cleaner filters need to b e cleaned before storing 
the machine.  
 It is preferable to apply some oil on the blade to prevent rusting when storing the 
machine for longer periods without use.

GUIDELINES FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF TEA TO FACILITATE 
MECHANIZATION OF FIELD OPERATIONS  
 
Introduction  
Tea is a labour -intensive plantation crop; hence, the labour requirement and cost are 
heavy. It has become necessary to introduce mechanization to tea plantations  since the tea 
sector is presently facing acute worker shortage .  
 
Mechanization in agriculture is the use of machine to accomplish a task or operation 
involved in agricultural production. Key objectives of mechanization are to increas e 
worker productivity, reduc e cost of production, improv e product quality, eas e manual 
operation s, complet e tasks timely  and chang e worker attitudes.  
 
Tea planting system facilitating mechanization of  field operation s 
Mechanization of field operations requires adequate space for worker and machine 
mobility , dense  canopy architecture  and absence of obstacles such as shade trees in the 
path of machine operation .  
 
The conventional  system of single -row planting at a spacing of 0.6 m x 1.2 m  (2 feet X 4 
feet) limits the use and efficiency of machines.  
 
The double hedge -row planting system commonly practiced in some other tea growing 
countries such as Japan  and China  pave s the way for mechanizing  most of the labour -
intensive field operation s such as  harvesting  successfully . Therefore, hedge -row planting 
system having a spacing of 0.6 m x 0.6  m x 1.5 m (2 feet X 2 feet X 5 feet: Figure 1) is 
considered amenable  to facilitate mechanization of post -planting tea field operations  in 
Sri Lanka .  
 
However, t he other special consideration s that require  greater attention are as follows;  
 As considerable space of land between two hedge -rows is exposed to rain thus soil 
erosion, this planting system is more suitable for  flat and undulating lands. 
Moreover , particular attention should be paid to cover such areas by mulching and 
planting of co ver crops  during early stages  of establishment to minimize soil 
losses and weed growth .  
 
 Due to high planting density  (theoretical density is 15,370 plants per hectare 
which is a bout 14% more than the theoretical plant density of conventional 
system: 13,450 plants per hectare ), competition for moisture during dry weather 
may lead to poor plant growth and drought casualties. Therefore, unfertile lands, Page 2 of 2 
 soils with poor moisture retention capacity and drought prone areas  are best 
avoided in hedge -row planting unless they are provided with irrigation facilities.  
Further more,  use of hardy tea cultivars with an erect -growth habit  recommended 
for the agro-climatic region s will minimize such disadvantages.   
 
 Rate of fertilizer application need s to be increased in par with number of plants 
per ha ( high plant density) . 
 
 Training of the hedge -row to form  a slightly curved plucking surface with the use 
of appropriate pruning machines will facilitate use of pruning/harvesting machines 
with dome -shaped blades.

Issued In: April 2020       Guideline No: 01/2020  
 
GUIDELINES ON MEASURES TO BE ADOPTED  IN TEA LANDS  
FOLLOWING A DROUGHT  
 
It is absolutely essential that the following measures  should  be adopted in tea lands  affected by a 
prolonged drought , in order to ensure optimal recovery of drought affected plants.  
 
NEWLY PLANTED TEA ( First  and Second y ear fields)   
 
1. Newly planted tea should be fertilized only after bud -break and when leaves of the new 
growth are  fully open.  
 
2. Bringin g into bearing operations should be delayed until the plants have re -foliated 
adequately.  
 
3. Assess the number of casualties in each newly planted field and resupply vacancies 
with quality  nursery plants, prior to undertaking the normal replanting planned for the year. 
Extents which could not be planted in the season should continue to be under grass until 
planting in the following season.  
 
4. If low shade tree s such as G liricidia , Dadap s have been affected, resupplying of shade or 
removal of dead branches may b e necessary.  
 
MATURE TEA  
 
1. Fertilizer Applications   
When favorable  weather conditions set in after  a period of prolonged drought, 
application of  fertilizer should be carried out carefully .  
 
Tea fields may have been affected by drought at varying levels and can be categorized as 
follows:  
  
(a) Fields showing no symptoms of drought but low in shoot production  
Fields  in this category  can be fertilized after  a period of 02 - 03 weeks  following the  
onset of monsoon and when bushes  show obvious signs of flushing .    
 
(b)  Fields affected in parts i.e. by wilt as well as scorch and some defoliation  
Such fields  can be fertilized only  after a period  of about 06  weeks , depending  on the extent of 
drought damage.  
 
 2 
 (c) Fields affected severely with extensive defoliation  
Fields in this category should not be  fertilized, until bushes have fully  re-foliate d, 
recovered and have commenced  flushing, which process could take about  03 - 06 months . 
 
2. Pruning  
Pruning of drought -affected fields should be  delayed until  the following con ditions 
are in place:   
(a) Bushes have recovered fully , and 
(b) Produced sufficient foliage ensur ing the availability  of adequate root reserves and good 
lungs that could be retained at pruning.  It is  best to rest such fields completely  without 
pluck ing until fully recovered . 
 
3. Plucking  
(a) Drought affected field s should be harvested only after bushes are fully 
recovered . 
 
(b) After a period of prolonged  drought  tea bushes are subjected to v arying degrees 
of stress . Hence , with the onset of rain s, adopt one  or two r ounds of light  plucking , even  in 
fields with  bushes showing no obvious /v i s i b l e  signs of drought effects  such as  
wilting and/or partial  defoliation .   
 
(c) If, however, a significant number  of bushes had wilted at some stage during the dry 
period and if some of which had shown partial defoliation, it is essential  to 
completely rest such sections in the field . Any a ttempt s to harvest should not be made at 
the first signs of flush.  
 
4. Re-supplying vacancies  
(a) Priority for infilling should be given to young and newly planted areas and then to VP 
tea areas with good soil conditions. Robust and hardier nursery plants should be used 
to infill vacancies . 
 
(b) Vacancies in seedling tea should be planted with appropriate soil -reconditioning . 
After soil-reconditioning,  infilling should be carried out with hardier specifical ly 
grown nursery plants, as already recommended for infilling normal vacancies in 
mature tea  fields .

GUIDELINES  ON PRE VENTION AND CONTROL OF SPREAD OF C OVID -19 IN 
TEA PLA NTATION S 
 
Entire world has been  affected by the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, commonly 
known as COVID -19. Sri Lanka is also currently experiencing COVID -19 threat.  Globally,  
COVID -19 pandemic w ill create significant impact s on economies and Sri Lanka is not 
exempted being an  upper middle -income  countr y. This will certainly create adverse outcomes 
in the health, social and economic settings in short,  medium and long er terms. 
 
COVID -19 is a respiratory disease and the transmission takes place  via following 3 routes : 
 
1. Droplets  - The virus can be transmitted by breathing infected droplets. Droplets can be 
produced during coughing or sneezing or even by exhales from infected persons. These 
droplets travel up to a distance of 1m.  
2. Direct - Person to person transmission by direct con tact with an infected person (E g. 
Hugging, Shaking hands). The virus enter s the body through nose, mouth or eyes.  
3. Indirect – When an infected person coughs, sneezes or exhales, droplets of infected fluid 
may release and contaminate nearby surfaces and obj ects, such as desks, tables, 
telephones, computers etc. An uninfected person may come in contact the virus by 
touching these surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  
 
Therefore, individual workplaces should  adopt best practices to avoid such t ransmissions 
through the routes  described herein. Individual behavior is also important in arresting 
transmission of this virus .  
 
Two simple measures adopted in public namely wearing face masks and not touching the face 
could protect any individual from infecting  with this virus . 
 
In the present context, workplaces need to modify the practices and the ir work ing 
environment s to prevent any possible transmission of COVID -19 infection. Therefore, 
stakeholders in the tea plantations are hereby advised to adopt  the following guidelines at 
their workplaces viz. tea field, factory and office, while complying with the Government 
directives  and Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services  guidelines issued time to 
time.  
 
The staff and workers of following categories  should not report for work;  
 
1. Those having fever, with or without acute onset respiratory symptoms such as cough, 
runny nose, sore throat and/or shortness of breath.  
2. Those who have had contact with suspected or confirmed case of COVID -19 for the last 
14 days  
3. Those  who are quarantined for COVID -19. 
 2 
 4. Those who are occupying premises and/or housing schemes declared as self - quarantine 
areas for suspected cases of COVID -19. 
 
A large number of people are frequently  gathered at the workplaces, it is a collective 
responsibility of persons to keep workplaces safe  and healthy . The lead responsibility for the 
implementation of this guide line lies w ith the management of each organiza tion. 
 
All staff and workers need to adhere to the recommendations append  below in order to avoid  
possible transmission of COVID -19 infection . 
 
 
General  
  
1. Identifying a suitable focal point (a responsible officer) to coordinate, monitor and control 
activities implemented against COVID -19 infection and provides  necessary guidance.  
2. Formulating a task force in each estate representing the management, field , factory, 
medical and welfare staff , and safety officer /s and community members as deemed 
necessary . 
3. Formulating vigilance committee within the plantation community to ensure proper 
coordination, feedback flow of information and decision taking etc. by the individual 
estate . 
4. Continue a wareness on COVID -19 spread and encourage stay at home and line room .  
5. Main taining records and census of all resident individuals,  visitors, influx personnel from 
other regions and countries, workers with reduced immunity and s uffering from diabetes, 
heart, kidney, liver, asthma and lung diseases, age over 40 years . 
6. Advise staff to minimize direct verbal communication between co -workers and use 
alternative methods (Public address system, intercom etc.) to provide instructions to  
workers and staff members.  
7. Discourage workers from the use of  other workers’ baskets, sacks, knives, mobile phones, 
pens and common telephones, desks and equipment  etc. If any object has been shared , it 
must be cleaned with soap and water or with minimum 70% v/v alcohol -based  sanitizer.  
8. Conduct review meetings periodically to monitor, obtain feedback and improve system s.  
9. In the event of detecting a suspected case at workplace, seek assistance from hotline 1390 
and follow the instructions given or alternat ively transfer the worker to the nearest 
government hospital, by ambulance. Suwasariya ambulance service can be contacted by 
dialing 1990.  
10. Deploy workers with less risk: persons  with reduced immunity and suffering from 
diabetes, heart, kidney, liver, asth ma and lung diseases, and age  over 40 years are 
vulnerable.

Issued In: August  2021       Guideline No: 02/2021  
 
GUIDELINES FOR TEA AND COCONUT INTERCROPPING  
(This guideline replaces Guideline issued on 26th April, 2000)  
 
Intercropping of tea and coconut is considered feasible in the mid and low country, in the 
agro-ecological regions, WM1, WM2, WM3, WL1 and WL2, where conditions are conducive 
for the cultivation of both these crops.  
 
The main objective is to enhance productivity of land.  
 
1. Intercropping procedure  
Coconut should be planted in an avenue system. The recommended spacing between avenues 
is 12 x 7.8 m (40 x 26 ft) .  According to this system of planting density of coconut is 102 palms 
per ha ( 42 palms per acre).  
 
The tea should be intercropped in the avenues of coconut leaving at least 2.4 m (8 ft) for the 
manure circle of coconut. The  spacing  of  tea  can vary  from 1.0 x 0.6 m (3.5 x 2 ft) to 1.2 x 
0.6 m (4 x 2  ft) depending on the growth habit s of tea cultivars .  
 
The details of number of coconut palms and tea plants under different spatial arrangements are 
given in Table. 1. In order to avoid excessive shade on tea, it is suggested that wherever 
possible coconut be planted in the East -West dir ection.  Fig. l illustrates the spatial arrangement 
of the tea and coconut intercropping.

3.2 Soil rehabilitation  
If the soil conditions are marginal (less than 90 cm soil depth, more than 20% gravel content 
and less than 2% soil organic carbon content) or if the soil is infested with nematodes, soil 
rehabi litation with Mana grass for a minimum period of 18  months  is recom mended. 
Alternatively , CO3 grass (Hybrid Napier) can be planted for a period of 12 months . When 
coconut and grass are planted simultaneously , it is recommended to cut a 1  x 1 ft (0. 3 x 0.3 m) 
trench , 6 ft ( 1.8 m) away f rom the coconut tree and plant grass in between two trenches as 
shown in Fig. 2.

Establish  one row of Gliricidia  at the spacing of 3.6 m (12 ft)  in the middle row of tea along the 
coconut avenue as shown in Fig. 1.  
 
3.4 C ultivars  
Use recommended cultivars for the region, depending on the soil and climatic conditions (TRI 
Advisory Circular PN 1) . 
 
3.5 Spacing  
1.0 x 0 .6 m (3.5 x 2.0 ft) - For cultivars  with erect growth habit , eg. TRI 2043,  TRI 4049 , S 106, 
DG 7 and  DG 39 . 
 
1.2 x 0.6 m (4.0  x 2.0 ft) - For other cultivars  with spreading growth habit . 
 
3.6 Planting holes/trenches  
Holes:  45 cm (18 inches) deep with a top diameter of 30 cm (12 inches) and  bottom diameter of 
22.5 cm (9 inches) . 
 
Trenches: 45 cm (18 inches) deep and 30 cm (1 2 inches) wide . 
 
3.7 Time of planting , and Pest control  
Planting of tea should be done with the onset o f South -West monsoon rains (May/June).  
 
For n ematode prone areas, a suitable nematicide may be applied as per the TRI Advisory 
Circular s No. PU 4 and PM 4 .  
 
For White Grub prone areas, preventive measures need  to be taken as per recommendations in 
the TRI Advisory Circular s PU 4 and PM 7 . 
 
3.8 After -care 
3.8.1  Thatching  
Thatching  should  be done soon after completion of planting tea and repeated before the tail end 
of the monsoon. Care should be taken to keep thatch material ( Mana, G autemala,  CO3  grass) 
15 cm (6 inches) away from the collar of the tea plant.  
 
3.8.2 Weed management  
Manual weeding is preferred . 
 
3.8.3 Fertilizer application  
Fertilizer applications should be done according to TRI recommendations (TRI  Advisory 
Circular Nos. SP 2, SP 3 , SP 6 and SP 10). 
 
3.8.4 Bringing into bearing  
As per recommended practices (TRI Advisory Circular No. PA 1). 
 
4. Intercropping tea in existing C oconut lands  
Lands presently under coconut may be inter -cropped with tea, provided that the soil and  
weather conditions are conducive for tea. The coconut palms should be over 35 years to allow  
sufficient sunlight falling on tea. Soil rehabilitation is essential for marginal  lands with  5 compacted  soil. Further more , planting tea in trenches of 30 cm (1 ft ) wide and 45 cm (1.5 ft) 
deep is  preferable. A shallow trench of 30  x 30 cm de ep (1 x 1 ft), 1.8 m (6 ft) away on either 
side of  coconut rows should be cut to minimize any adverse effect of rehabilitation grass on 
growth  of coconut.  
 
4.1 Planting arrangement  
To avoid competition, tea should be planted at least 2.4 m (8.0 ft) away from the coconut palm.  
Two systems of planting can be adopted for planting tea in existing coconut lands.  
 
a) Planting tea only in the avenues of coconut  
In this system, tea is established only in the inter -rows of coconut. The spacing can vary 
from 1.0 - 1.2 m (3.5 - 4.0 ft) between rows and  0.6 m (2.0 ft) within the row depending 
on growth habit of tea cultivars ( see section 3.5 above).  
 
b) Planting tea in the ent ire space betw een coconut palms  
In this system, tea can be planted at a spacing of 1.0 x 0.6 m (3.5  x 2.0 ft) or 1 .2 x 0.6 m 
(4.0 x 2.0 ft.) cover ing the entire space in the coconut square leaving a radius of 2.4 m  
(8.0 ft) from the coconut palm . 
 
Other considerations  
1) In order to allow movement of carts and tractors  etc., it is advisable to leave one 
coconut avenue for every 5 to 6 avenues without planting tea.  
 
2) In coconut plantations with irregular spacing , it may not be possible to plant tea in a 
systematic manner. In  such lands tea should be planted in the space available after 
leaving 2.4 m (8.0 ft) from the coconut palm.  
 
3) All cultivation practices and after -care for both tea and coconut should be carried 
out according to TRI and CRI recommendations. It is advisable to consult relevant 
Advisory and Extension Officers for necessary assistance.

Issued In: August 2021                Guideline No: 03/2021  
 
INDUSTRY GUIDELINES  FOR  
COPPER ALLOY CAST CO MPONENTS IN ROTORVAN ES 
 
Introduction  
Rotorvanes are used in manufacturing Orthodox broken type teas. These Rotorva nes consist 
of copper alloy cast components for effective maceration of tea. Quality of made tea and 
dhool production rate are affected as a result of wear and tear  of the components . A study 
was conducted on sample components for chemical composition, har dness and microstructure 
and causes for high  wear and tear  were identified. This guideline briefs basic information on 
casting requirement, test method and quality requirement for the copper alloy cast 
components .   
Scope  
 Requirements for casting component s and 
 Test Method  for cast components  
 
Components  
  Vanes  for all sizes of rotorvanes  
  Resistors  for all sizes of rotorvanes  
 
Requirements  for casting components  
 Materials  
o Main ingot m aterials needed are Cu, Sn and Zn.  
                        Or  
o Scrap mat erials with known c hemical composition.  
It is highly recommended to work with a particular foundry to obtain cast 
components made of ingot  material . When the cast components are wasted , it 
can be reused to maintain chemical composition in the cast componen ts closer 
to the requirement.  The cost of new components  could be  reduced with reuse 
of the material.  
 
 Method of casting  
o Sand casting  
o Preparing quality green sand with the characteristics: refractoriness, chemical 
inertness, permeability, surface finish , cohesiveness, flowability, collapsibility, 
and availability/cost. (Described in Annexure A ). 
o Melting order – ‘Cu’ first followed by ‘Sn’ and ‘Zn’ at the final stage . 
Losses of elements  in the form of vapour occurs as the melting point of Cu, Sn 
and Zn va ry as 1,085 °C, 231.9 °C and 419.5 °C respectively.  
o Casting components of different thicknesses at appropriate temperatures. 
Recommended casting temperature s for producing components of different 
thickness es are given in Table 1. 2 
 Table 1. Casting tempera tures for components of different thicknesses  
Thickness of components  Casting temperature  
< 15 mm  1,200 °C

> 40 mm  1,130 °C  
 
Test Method for cast components  
 Optical emission spectroscopy  
 
Testing facility  
 Industrial Development Boa rd, Ratmalana and  
 Department of M aterials  Engineering, University of Moratuwa . 
 
Quality requirement for  casted components  
 Chemical composition (%) of Cast components,  
o Cu  86 – 89 %  
o Sn  9 – 11 %  
o Zn  1 – 3 % 
o Pb  1 – 1.3 %  
 
Range of percentage is given to t he elements considering practical difficulties in 
achieving exact composition. Allowing lead is to improve the machinability. As 
the cast components are contacting tea, extreme care should be taken not to allow 
lead content exceed the maximum of 1.3%.  
 
 Smooth Surface  
 Free from flaws, seams, cracks  
 Minimum impurities

 1. Green sand  characteristics:   
Refractoriness : The sand's ability to withstand the temperature of the liquid metal being 
cast without breaking down. Sand with too low refractoriness will melt a nd fuse to the 
casting.  
Chemical inertness : The sand must not react with the metal being cast.  
Permeability : The sand's ability to exhaust gases. This is important to avoid  casting 
defects , such as blow holes and gas holes  
Surface finish : The size and shape of the sand particles defines the best surface finish 
achievable . Finer particles lead to producing a better finish. However, finer the particle,  
the permeability become s worse.  
Cohesiveness  (or bond ): The ability of the sand to retain a given shape after the pattern is 
removed.  
Flowability : The ability for the sand to flow into intricate details and tight corners.  
Collapsibility : The ability of the sand to be easily st ripped off the casting after it has 
solidified. Special additives can be used to avoid cracking and  hot tears  in the casting 
during cooling or with long freezing temperature ranges .  
Avai lability/cost : The availability and cost of the sand is especially  important because 
for every ton of metal poured, three to six tons of sand is required.  Although sand can be 
screened and reused, the particles eventually become too fine and require period ic 
replacement with fresh sand.   
It is economical to use two different sands,  
a. Facing sand - this sand will be built up around the pattern to a thickness  of 30 to 
100 mm.  
b. Backing sand - the sand that fills in around the facing sand. This sand is simply 
silica sand with only a small amount of binder and no special additives.   
 
2. Green sand additives  
a. Base sand  
Silica sand of AFS grain size 50  - 60 is generally  used.  
b. Clay  
The best bonding clays are bentonites .   
c. Coal dust  
Used mainly in iron foundries with so me being used in non -ferrous foundries.  
d. BENTOKOL  
BENTOKOL additives are blends of natural clays to which have been added 
specially selected essential volatiles to provide both bond and volatile content .  
e. Water  
Water is needed to develop the clay bond bu t at times  it cause s casting defects.

 THE TEA RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF SRI LANKA  
 
Issued in:  December 2021       Guideline No: 0 4/2021 
 
Interim Guideline s on Strategic C ost Component Management in Tea  Cultivation with 
Special Reference to Rational Use of Plant Nutrients  and Tea Manufacture  
 
1. Background/Rationale  
Ultimate objective of any enterprise is optimizing  the profit s and the same is true for the 
stakeholders in tea supply and value chain  as well.  The p rofit is defined as the difference 
between the sale price and cost of the product  (COP ). Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 
the cost components as minimum as possible and obtain high er price s to accrue  higher profit 
margin s. Ensuring the best quality of end-product and adding value  to them will also increase 
the Net Sale Average (NSA) of graded tea. 
 
With limited availability and higher input costs, it is necessary to identify appropriate 
strategies for the rational use of such inputs in order to manage cost s and minimiz e impacts on 
sustainable production .  
 
The purpose of th is interim guideline  is to advise  the growers  and producers on key  strategies  
to manag e cost components in tea cultivation and processing. However, it should be cautioned  
that the curtailment of inputs such as fertilizers  need not be continued as a routine practice as 
they adversely affect productivity.  
 
2. Strategic cost management in tea cultivati on 
2.1 Rational u se of plant nutrients for tea fields   
The costs of plant nutrients  and application s vary from 6  - 12% of total cost of production  
(COP) . Hence, r ational use of plant nutrients is important to maintain tea land s profit ably.  
 
 Do not curtail fertilizer inputs for tea nurser ies and immature tea (up to formative 
pruning)  in the use of T  65, and T  200 and T  750 mixtures respectively and continue as 
recommend ed (Refer Advisory Circulars SP1 and SP2)   
 An interim recommendation on a  fertilizer mixture containing Sulphate of Ammonia 
(SA), Eppawela Rock Phosphate (E RP) and Muriate of Potash (MOP)  formulated as 
T1240 is made  for the use in mature tea fields.  
 The composition and nutrient concentrations of T 1240 are given in  Table 1.

SA ERP MOP  N P2O5  K2O S 
T1240  970 103 167 16.1 2.3 8.0 18.7 
 2 
  Use nitrogen (N) rationally for mature tea based on the average yields as detailed in 
Tables 2 and 3  for corporate sector and small holdings respectively  so that every 100  kg 
of made tea  below and above the yield level of 1400 made tea kg per ha per year 
receives on average 08 kg and 10 kg of N respectively .

 Apply T1240 mixture 2, 3 and 4 times a year for tea fields yielding less than 800 kg, 
800-1400 kg and above 1400 kg of made tea per ha per year (<130, 130 -220 & >220 kg 
green leaf per ac per month)  respectively.  
 Apply fertilizer from plant to plant for tea fields yielding less than 800 kg of made tea 
per ha per year (<130 green leaf per ac per month)  
 Test soil pH regularly and correct soil acidity (optimum range of pH being 4.5 -5.5) by 
applying dol omite prior to chemical fertilizer application to improve nutrient 
availability and plant uptake as given in Table 4 as per the recommend ation s (Refer 
Advisory Circular SP3).  
 Use compost  to improv e nutrient use efficiency and soil pH buffering capacity . 
However , compost made  from  municipal waste is not permitted  due to possible 
contamination with heavy metals . 
 Apply compost preferably at the rate of 5 metric tons per ha per year (2 metric tons per 
acre per year) in low country and 2.5 metric tons per ha p er year (1 metric ton per acre 
per year) in up country, mid country and Uva regions or 20 metric tons  per hectare (8 
metric per acre) at the prune in low country and 10 metric tons per hectare  at the prune 
in up country , mid country and Uva region s depending on the availability . Wherever 
possible, incorporate compost into soil by envelope forking.

2.2 Adopt  shorter plucking r ounds  to improve  tea yield, leaf standard and quality of made tea  
2.3 Give priority and d eploy maximum workforce  for plucking  (harvesting)  
2.4 Use suitable machines for labour intensive operations such as plucking, pruning and 
weeding  
2.5 Adhere to  rest fields prior to  pruning and advocate correct length of pruning c ycle (3 year 
cycle for VP tea in low country and 4 -5 year cycle for VP tea in up  country , mid country 
and Uva regions) . Undue shortening of cycles will lead to more non -productive periods 
(recovery after pruning).  
2.6 Adopt  alternative worker deployment models  (AWDMs)  such as offering work to estate 
workers on contractual basis, cash plucking, block plucking, contract farming systems  
and out grower system  to overcome labour scarcity  and  improve  labour productivity .  
2.7 Monitor  key field operations  such as plucking, pruning, fertilizer application to ensure 
high worker productivity and quality of field operation s)  
2.8 Adhere to soil and moisture conservation and integrated fertility management strategies 
as per TRI guidelines to ensure minimize inpu t losses.  
2.9 Adhere to integrated approaches as per TRI guidelines on seasonal and perennial pest and 
disease incidences affecting yield and quality.  
2.10 Adhere to integrated weed management strategies as per TRI guidelines to ensure higher 
yield .  Consolidate ground cover  by infilling and planting of mana in vacant patches  to 
suppress weed growth.  
2.11 Improve productivity  of tea lands  by infilling of vacancies , replanting , timely 
management of pest and diseases,  and adoption of  other key good agricultural practices . 
2.12 Diversify t ea lands with poor soil conditions into appropriate use such as establishment of 
fuel-wood blocks and thatch banks /grass planting.   
 
3. Strategic cost management in tea manufacture  
3.1  Process only standard leaf with a view to reduc ing processing time and thereby reducing 
cost of worker and energy ; and minimize ware and tare of machinery  in tea factories.  4 
 3.2 Use suitable size dryer and required number of machiner ies only for optimiz ing 
performance and productivity  
3.3 Implement formal energy audits with TRI assistance and determine critical points in 
factory operations for corrective measures  
3.4 Strictly monitor and r educe energy consumption  by an appropriate e nergy (electrical and 
thermal) management plan. For exampl e, maintain required stock of cut, split and dried 
firewood and use it to generat e hot air for withering and drying processes.  
3.5 Implement GMPs (Good Manufacturing Practices); follow properly designed rolling 
programme and grading programme and control process parameters such as hygrometric 
difference in air for withering, dryer temperatures and airflow for withering and drying , 
and i ntroduce monitoring and controlling systems in tea manufacturing to ensure 
implementation of GMPs.  
3.6 Suitably re -siting  machinery and automate/conveyori se appropriately for smooth tea 
manufacture  
3.7 Avoid operating the factory under -capacity.  
3.8 Train factory staff and workers on all the aspect s in relation to  tea manufacture and 
factory operations to improve their perfo rmance/productivity  
3.9 Introduce proper record keeping  approach  for routine monitori ng of cost components

 TEA RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF SRI LANKA  
 
Issued in: December 2018   Guideline No: 0 2/2018  
 
GUIDELINES ON THE USE OF CO -3 GRASS (HYBRID NAPIER) FOR SOIL 
REHABILITATION BEFORE REPLANTING OF TEA  
IN THE LOW COUNTRY  
 
Introduction  
Soil rehabilitation for a period o f 18-24 months  before replanting of old tea , is a must 
to improve soil  conditions , minimize weed,  pest and disease infestations  and reduce 
soil toxicity .  Most of the farmers are reluctant to grow rehabilitation grass es for such 
a long period  before tea cu ltivation since there is no income generat ed during this 
period. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of planting materials of recommended 
rehabilitation grass species such as Mana and Guatemala, particularly in the low 
country tea growing region. Therefore , it has become necessary  to identify alternative 
grass  species to reduce the length of soil rehabilitation period.  The Hybrid  Napier  
grass (Pennisetum purpureum x Pennisetum americanum ), Variety CO -3 with 
following beneficial characteristics has been proven to be a  suitable alternative to 
Mana and Guatemala . 
 
Characteristics of CO-3 Grass  
 This is one of the inter-specific  Hybrid Napier varie ties used for fodder 
production. The hybridization occur s naturally between two species such as  
Common Napier  (Pennisetu m purpureum ) and Pearl millet  (Pen nisetum 
americanum) . These  two species readily cross and that the resultant inter  
specific hybrids are more vigorous than the parent species and highly sterile. 
Therefore , it can be used as fo dder without danger of becomin g a weed . 
 
 It has a  well ecological adaptability to the low country climatic condition s and 
a high grow th rate. 
 
 It improves soil chemical, p hysical and biological properties.  
 
 It has more  leafy growth and  show s high coppicing ability. Hence, appreciable  
number of loppings could be obtained within a short period of time.  
 
 Hybrid Napier variety has a higher tillering ability than Mana  (Cymbopogon 
confertiflorus)  or Guatemala  (Tripsacum laxum)  grass species . 
 Page 2 of 3 
  It gives h igher shoot and root biomass production than Mana and Guatemala  
(Table 1 and 2). As a result,  it add s highe r quantity of organic matter into the 
sub soil  at the end of rehabilitation  period.   
 
 The weed management cost during  rehabilitation period could  also be reduced 
due to rapid growth habit  of the grass , covering the land within a very short 
period of time  
 
Table 1: Above ground dry matter production ( Metric tons per ha) 
Type of grass  After 12 months  After 18 months  
CO-3 30.3 - 43.4 38.1 - 63.6 
Guatemala  20.1 - 21.7 31.7 - 32.5 
Mana  14.3 - 20.3 19.5 - 26.2 
 
Table 2: Root dry matter production ( Metric tons per ha) 
Type of grass  After 12 months  
CO-3 7.9 - 11.7 
Guatemala  3.9 - 5.8 
Mana  1.6 - 5.0 
 
Climatic and s oil requirements  for CO-3 grass    
The CO-3 grass grows well in high rainfall are as (in excess of 1500 mm per year)  and 
under full sunlight. The o ptimum temperature range for its growth is 25 – 40oC. The 
CO-3 grass  is very susceptible to frost.  Hence, it is not suitable for tea growing 
regions at high elevation s especially above 1500  m amsl . Water logg ing and very 
acidic soil conditions are also not conducive for growth of CO -3 grass . 
 
Planting of CO -3 Grass  
 After uprooting old tea, prepare and  level the land for planting of grasses. 
Dolomite should be applied at the recommended rate t o improve soil pH to the 
desirable range  (Please refer TRI Advisory Circular No. SP 6 on Fertilizer 
Recommendations For Rehabilitation Grasses, I ssued in July 2000) . 
 
 Fresh cuttings with 3 -4 nodes  soon after removal  from the mother plants are 
recommended  for planting as s ufficient amount s of food and water reserve s 
should be present  for successful sprou ting of buds and initial growth.  
 
 The grass cuttings should be planted at  the beginning of rainy season at a spacing 
of 0.3  m x 0.6 m; Approximately  55,500 stem-cutting s are required  for one 
hectare . 
 Page 3 of 3 
  Cuttings should be pla nted in holes made with a pointed stick or ‘Alavangu’ at an 
angle of 45  degrees  from the ground leaving  at least 2 nodes above the ground  and 
the soil around the cutting should be compacted w ell without leaving any air 
pockets. 
 
Fertilizer  application  
The grass should be regularly fertilized  using  the fertilizer mixture U  625 (Please refer TRI 
Advisory Circular No. SP 6 on Fertilizer Recommendations For Rehabilitation Grasses, 
Issued in July 2 000) similar to  other rehabilitation grasses . The quantities and times of 
fertilizer application s are 160, 210, and 310 kg per ha at the time of sprouting new shoots, 
after the 1st lopping, and after the 2nd and 3rd lopping respectively.   
 
Management  practices 
It takes about 4 -8 weeks  to form a good ground cover.  The grass should be lopped at 
regular intervals and the loppings should be spread on the ground between the contour 
rows. The first lopping  can be done  at a height of 45  – 60 cm from ground about 3 
months  after planting  and the  subsequent loppings could be done around 75 - 90 cm 
above the ground. The l opping should be done before the grass flowers and 4 loppings 
per year  are possible . It needs to be protected from the animals as it is a fodder grass . 
At the  end of the one-year rehabilitation period, g rass should be cut at the ground 
level and the stem parts should be removed from the field to prevent re -growth .

.,
Pestproblems thatcauseeconomic damagetotheSriLankanteaplantations couldbe
categorised intoinsectpests,nematodes (eelworms), diseases andweeds.TheTeaResearch
Institute (1Rl)ofSriLankahadbeenadvising theteagrowers tofollowanIntegrated Pest
Management (IPM)strategytoovercome theseproblems andthesamehadbeenadoptedbythe
teagrowers. Chemical controlofpestsisanintegralpartoftheIPMstrategy. However, thisis
usedasthelastresortwhenenvironmentally fTiendlyandoftenmoreeconomical othermethods
cannotcontroltheproblemtoasatisfactory level.
Random analysisofSriLankanteabyindependent organisations suchasEuropean Tea
Committee (ETC)revealsthatpesticide residuelevelsinSriLankanteasarewellbelowthe
Maximum ResidueLimits(MRL).Incidences ofnon-compliance areveryrareandinve;tigations
revealthatthisismostlyduetoblendingofSriLankanteawithteasofotherorigins. .
SriLankadoesnotmanufacture pesticides. Whenimporting pesticides, theRegistrar of
Pesticides (ROP)implements veryrigorous procedures, topreventanyhazardous chemicals
beingimported intothecountry.SriLankahadbannedtheuseofalmostalltheproblematic
chemicals. Relevant government institutes (inthecaseoftea,theTRI)arealsoinvolved inthe
screening procedure, priortogranting permission toimport/use apesticide. TRIcurrently
recommends 31chemicals tocontrolweeds,pestsanddiseasesintea.Allthesechemicals were
subjected tothescreening procedure mentioned above.Inaddition, continuous reviewing is

Tos Al1 kegistered Tea Manufacturers,

Dear Sir/Madam,

Sale of BM Fannings

The Sri Lanka Tea Board has decided to permit the sale of
BM Fannings by public auction.

Ze In view of this, BH Fannings must be treated as if it were

a grade of tea. It will now be exported and consumed as a foode-

stuff. It is therefcre essential that care should be taken in
its preparation, handling and storage under the most strict
hygienic conditions in order to prevent microbial contamination
at factory level. Every effort should be made to avoid storing
it for long pericds, particularly under damp conditions, and
also to keep out all extraneous matter. ;

3.00 It will be necessary for all due precautions to be taken

‘in the preparation. of: BM Fannings. just as it is necessary to

take such precautions for. the familiar grades of tea sold at
the Auctions. | ,

(i) Each Licensed’ Dealer in green leaf shall be attached to one
Bought Leaf factory for the purpose of supplying his collected
leaf for manufacture. However, he could deliver leaf to more —
than one factory by explaining such necessity and obtaining
prior approval from the Tea Commissioner. In unavoidable
circumstances, such as any breakdown in the manufacturing
process in the allotted. factory, a Licensed Dealer may deliver
the leaf collected by him to any other factory with the consent
of the manufacturer of that factory. He should inform the Tea

Commissioner of such delivery with relevant details; os

(ii) Kvery Licensed Dealer should,submit once a fortnight, to the “
factory allotted to him, a list of suppliers containing their |
nawes and addresses, the registered number of the tea lands,
and -the quantity of leaf supplied by each of then;

' | : a

i; (iii) Every Licensed Dealer should obtain in duplicate, receipts for
payment made by him to green leaf suppliers and submit the

t duplicates of such receipts to the factory concerned. |

3. © Commencing from the month of October 1984, you should inform in writing,’

every supplier who has delivered leaf to the factory direct or through a Licensed

.Dealer, the quantity of green leaf supplied by him during the previous month and

the rato payable per kilogranume of leaf.(Specimen form attached). |

Tea Control act, No.51 of 1957, wherein Registered Manufacturers purchasing green
leaf are required to maintain a Register on Form TC.15 giving details of leaf
purchased and obtain declarations on Form TC.19 in support thereof. These
documents should be naintained daily and made available for inspection whenever
required by field officers of this Department and the Tea Small Holdings
Developuent Authority. Oo ~

De You are also kindly requested to retain the lists of leaf suppliers and
the duplicate receipts which are delivered to you by the Licensed Dealers for _
a period of ane year, and produce then for inspection whenever required. You

that the quality of the tea produced in your factory has been ccnstantly bolo

pricsos well below the avarage price received by amall-noldars in that elevational
category. -. ‘

Ze “It is vory important that you take necessary action to Anprove the
quality of teas manufactured at your factory, by improving the standard ui
processing, You should alsocxervise contrcl on the standard of leat pormitted

Sir,
Damaged Made Tea due to Natural Causes and otherwise

Sri Lanka Tea Board observes that owners of made tea, in various stages of the
disposal channels manage to minimize their losses, due to damages caused to made tea
on account of natural causes or otherwise through insurance covers. This loss recovery
mechanism culminates with the releasing of a considerable volume of damaged teas,
which are either contaminated with Microbiological elements or Chemical substances in
to the export blends through unscrupulous parties. This has tarnished the image of
‘Ceylon Tea’ abroad, damaging the reputation established by the exporters, over decades
of hard work.

02. Considering the adverse repercussion of the said unethical trading practice, it has
sant been decided to monitor such transactions, with immediate effect.

03. Where any tea is damaged due to natural causes and otherwise that will deem the
said tea unfit for sale through approved channels or otherwise, shall be declared by the
registered exporter, manufacturer or produce broker to the Sri Lanka Tea Board, within
a period of one week from the said incident: and an acknowledgement obtained.
Specimen Form for this purpose is annexed. No such teas should be released to an
insurance company or its agent or any other person without the prior written consent of
the Sri Lanka Tea Board.

Dear Sir,

Damage to Tea Factories arising
out of Terrorist attacks.

I refer to my letter No. OR/1/106 dated 2ist June, 1986
wherein it was stated, that the Sri Lanka Tea Board would compensate
tea factory owners for loss or damage caused to tea factories by terrorist

attacks.

2. The Tea Board reviewed this matter at its meeting held
on 4th May, 1989 and decided to withdraw this indemnity with immediate
effect, as it does not have the financial resources to undertake this

commitment.

Damaged Made Tea due to Natural Causes and otherwise

Sri Lanka Tea Board observes that owners of made tea, in various stages of the
disposal channels manage to minimize their losses, due to damages caused to made tea
on account of natural causes or otherwise through insurance covers. This loss recovery
mechanism culminates with the releasing of a considerable volume of damaged teas,
which are either contaminated with Microbiological elements or Chemical substances in
to the export blends through unscrupulous parties. This has tarnished the image of
‘Ceylon Tea’ abroad, damaging the reputation established by the exporters, over decades
of hard work.

rt ;
o2. Considering the adverse repercussion of the said unethical trading practice, it has
been decided to monitor such transactions, with immediate effect.

03. Where any tea is damaged due to natural causes and otherwise that will deem the
said tea unfit for sale through approved channels or otherwise, shall be declared by the
registered exporter, manufacturer or produce broker to the Sri Lanka Tea Board, within
a period of one week from the said incident and an acknowledgement obtained.
Specimen Form for this purpose is annexed. No such teas should be released to an
insurance company or its agent or any other person without the prior written consent of
the Sri Lanka Tea Board.

Tea Commissioner's Division

 

To all Registered Tea Manufacturers

 

Directions given under Section §(2) of the Tea Control Act No. 51 of
1957 as amended, to preserve the naturainess of made tea.

tl ee ee ee

 

1, Section 8(2) of the Tea Control Act No. 51 of 1957 as amended requires
that the ummuer of operation (the (ea manufacturing process) of a lea
factory should be conducive to the manufacture of made tea of good
quality. Tea is a natural drink derived from the tea plant (Camellia
sinensis), Accordingly, the manner of operation of a tea factory should
guarantee the preservation of ihe ualuraluess of uuade ea.

nN

The naturalness of made tea will be harmed if attempts are made to
enhance the blackness of tea by artificial means.

3. Artificial means of enhancing the blackness of tea result in a product
containing foreign substances harmful to huauan health and depleted of ils
natural substances which destroys the naturalness of tea and hence, its
quality from the point of view of its final customer. It can bring about a
total rejection of Sri Lankan tea from the international market with serious
repercussions ou ihe econouy of Sri Lanka. Another serivus cepercussion

would be the encouragement of the supply of sub standard leaf.

4. Accordingly, in order to preserve the naturalness of made tea, by virtue of
the powers vested in mé’by'Sevtion'8(Z) of the Tea Control Act No. 51 of
1957 as amended, you aré hereby directed to;

i, Refrain from making any attempts to artificially blacken tea.

ii. Refrain from storing any substance that could be used to artificially
blacken tea within the tea factory or its premises. These substances
include inter alia, substances that are purported to be natural, such
as commercially available enzymes.

5. Within the meaning of section 8(2) of the Tea Control Act No, 51 of 1957 as
amended, blackening tea by artificial means shall be considered as nmaking
the manner of operation of a tea factory to a standard non-conducive to
manufacture made tea of good quality. Accordingly, steps shall be taken
to suspend or cancel the registration of such tea factory.

Non-compliance with the above directions shall be considered as an
offence under section 39 of the aforesaid act. Accordingly, by the powers
vested in me by Section 5& (3) of the aforesaid act, I have empowered
officers authorized by me to enter any tea factory without prior notice or
break into any tea factory at any time of the day where there is reasonable
grounds to believe that this offence is being comunitted.

By the powers vested in me by Section 55(2) of the aforesaid act, I have
empowered officers authorized by me to demand any record and any
declaration (either verbal or written) and make copies of any entries in
such records or dedaraliuns, obtain photographs and samples of
substances found in violation of the aforesaid directions, as evidence. By
the powers vested in me by section 14(a) of the Tea (Tax and Control) of
Exports Act No. 16 of 1959 as amended the officers authorized by me shall

be empowered to remove samples of tea for testing the quality.
Cont'd...2/-

 
11.

12.

 

registered tea manufacturer who makes defawt in complying with

aforesaid directions shall be guilty of making the manner of operation

the factory non conducive to manufacture made tea of good quality and

sy the powers vested in ine by section 8(2) of the aforesaid act, the
registration of such factory may be suspended or cancelled.

Under section 39 of the aforesaid act, every person who makes default in
complying with the aforesaid directions shall be guilty of an offence.

Under section 40 of the aforesaid act, every person who resists or
obstructs my authorized officers in the performance or exercise of their
legitimate duties shall be guilty of an offence.

Under section 45 of the aforesaid act, every person who is guilty of an
offence shall be prosecuted and on conviction after sumunery trial before a
magistrate be liable to a fine of Rs. 50,000/- or to a term of imprisonment

selling brokers by producing samples of tea which conform the Minimum Quality
Standard on leaf appearance under both standards. Board directed me to introduce the
specimen standard samples of tea through Tea Tasting Unit or Lab to the trade.

You may therefore take action to prepare minimum 15 samples of tea (each
100grm-150grm) of Minimum Quality Standard of both black and green. 8 such samples
can handover to 8 selling brokers as specimen to follow suit for monitoring. Other
reserve standard samples can be used within the institution for inquiry from any party

who feed to vprify the M.Q.Standard of made tea.

Sirs,

EX?CRT OF TEA

 

It is observed that exporters prepared their consignment of tea for exportation especially
in bulk form without identifying the packagercase/chest by using a ruhning number/Lot
Nos. Due to the above reason mest of the shippe:s prepare their cargo as part shipments
with identical shipping marks and other details without indicating package numbers.
‘This will be a problem at the point of pre-shipment sampling to identify the actual cargo
for monitoring purposes.

In order to samy out pre-shipment sampling effectively you are hereby informed to
follow the under-mentioned procedure with immediate effect.

i) Running number should be stenciled oti each and every bulk package or case
up to the total number of packages of the contract.

ii) In case of partial shipment under the same contract the running number should
be continued without duplication. ‘

iii) Under marks and numibers of the CUSDEC tange of the package numbers/Loi
Nos. should be declared. .

The above system would facilitate to identify the actual number of packages of the
consignment completed and shipped both to you and the Tea Board officials, You are
therefore, requested to comply with the above requirement prior to confirming the date of
pre-shipment sampling of our officers.
